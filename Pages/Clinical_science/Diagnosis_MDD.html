        <h1>Definition, history and epidemiology</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Major depressive disorder (MDD)</b>, also referred to as a depressive disorder or depression, is
            characterised by a<b>low mood and/or a notable reduction in interest or pleasure in nearly all activities,
                occurring almost daily for
                most of the day, over at least two consecutive weeks</b>. To be diagnosed with MDD, an individual must
            experience fiveor more specific symptoms during this two-week period, with at least one being either
            depressed mood or loss of
            interest or pleasure. These symptoms must cause <b>clinically significant distress or impairment</b> in
            social,
            occupational, or other important areas of functioning and not be attributable to a substance or another
            medical
            condition. In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad.
            <br><br>Key symptoms of MDD include:
            <br> - Depressed mood (sombere stemming)
            <br> - Loss of interest or pleasure (verlies van interesse of plezier)
            <br> - Changes in appetite or weight
            <br> - Sleep problems, particularly sleep-through disturbances (doorslaapstoornissen)
            <br> - Psychomotor agitation or inhibition
            <br> - Fatigue or loss of energy
            <br> - Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
            <br> - Indecisiveness
            <br> - Concentration problems
            <br> - Suicidal behaviour or thoughts
            <br><br>Historically, the <b>monoamine hypothesis</b> has been one of the most widely accepted models of
            depression
            pathophysiology, postulating that MDD results from a depletion of neurotransmitters like serotonin,
            norepinephrine,
            and dopamine in the central nervous system. However, this model has limitations, as up to 30% of patients do
            not
            respond to monoaminergic antidepressants, and these medications are effective in psychiatric disorders with
            different pathophysiologies.
            <br><br>MDD is a <b>major global cause of disability</b> and is predicted to rank first in disease burden by
            2030,
            affecting
            approximately 300 million people worldwide. The incidence of MDD is increasing annually, particularly among
            pregnant
            women, elderly people, and children. The prevalence of MDD can vary sevenfold across diverse cultures,
            though
            consistency is observed in the female-to-male ratio, mean ages at onset, and the likelihood of comorbid
            substance
            abuse. There are no clear differences by gender in the phenomenology, course, or treatment response of MDD,
            although
            hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic symptoms (especially
            psychomotor
            disturbances) are more common in older individuals.

        <h1>Diagnosis & criteria</h1>
        <p>
            Current clinical diagnostic criteria for MDD are largely <b>subjective and based primarily on clinical
                symptoms</b>,
            which can lead to high rates of missed and incorrect diagnoses. The standard diagnostic tool for MDD is the
            <b>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)</b>, which requires at least five symptoms
            to
            be
            present for a minimum of two weeks, including depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure. Other diagnostic
            tools
            include the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the International Classification of
            Diseases-10
            (ICD-10).
            <br><br>Identifying potential <b>biomarkers for MDD</b> is crucial for accurate diagnosis, faster treatment,
            and
            effective
            monitoring. Recent research is exploring new diagnostic approaches, including:
            <br> - <b>Potential serum indicators:</b>
            <br> - -> <b>NOX1 and Raftlin</b> are novel biomarkers with good diagnostic value, with elevated levels
            associated
            with MDD
            through oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.
            <br> - -> <b>Chemokine-like protein TAFA-5 (FAM19A5)</b> levels are increased in MDD patients and correlate
            with
            reactive
            astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
            <br><br> - <b>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indicators:</b>
            <br> - -> <b>Structural MRI techniques</b> (e.g., voxel-based morphometry) can detect abnormal grey matter
            volume
            (GMV) in
            several brain regions, which is positively correlated with MDD.
            <br> - -> <b>Resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI)</b> is a promising non-invasive technique that reveals cerebral
            functional
            abnormalities and hypoconnectivity within the frontoparietal network (FN) and the default mode network (DMN)
            in
            MDD
            patients.
            <br> - -> Indicators like <b>amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of
                low-frequency
                fluctuation
                (fALFF), regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity (FC)</b> show promise as neuroimaging markers
            for
            MDD.
            <br><br> - <b>New multi-modal evaluation scales:</b>
            <br> - -> Combining structural and functional features, such as through <b>radiomics analysis</b>, can help
            distinguish MDD
            patients from healthy controls.
            <br> - -> Integrating <b>omics and neuroimaging techniques</b>, like 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A/1B
            methylation
            data with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data, can improve diagnostic accuracy.
            <br><br>Despite these advancements, widely accepted objective diagnostic indicators or methods for MDD
            remain
            deficient,
            partly due to unclear pathogenesis and limitations in detection instrument sensitivity and accuracy.

        <h1>Aetiology & pathophysiology</h1>
        <p>
            The pathological mechanisms of MDD are complex and not fully understood, with multiple interacting
            hypotheses
            contributing to its pathogenesis. It is widely accepted that MDD is associated with multiple pathogenic
            factors,
            rather than a single cause.
            <b>Widely Accepted Pathogenesis Hypotheses and Factors:</b>
            <br> - <b>Neurotransmitter and Receptor Hypothesis (Monoamine Hypothesis):</b> This traditional theory
            suggests
            that
            deficiencies in monoamine neurotransmitters, such as <b>serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine
                (NE)</b>,
            are a root cause of clinical depression. However, this hypothesis cannot fully explain MDD pathogenesis.
            <br><br>Abnormal
            increases in other neurotransmitters like <b>glutamate, GABA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</b> also have
            a
            high
            relationship with MDD pathogenesis.
            <br> - <b>Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Dysfunction Hypothesis:</b> High levels of
            glucocorticoids
            play a core
            role in MDD pathogenesis, with thyroid hormone and estrogen also involved in HPA axis functions.
            Stress-induced
            hyperactivity of the HPA axis leads to negative feedback imbalance, contributing to depression.
            <br> - <b>Cytokine (Inflammatory) Hypothesis:</b> MDD is accompanied by changes in proinflammatory cytokines
            (e.g., IL-1β,
            IL-6, TNF-α) and trophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neuroinflammation, the
            abnormal
            immune response in the brain, is increasingly recognised as involved in MDD through various neurobiological
            mechanisms. Oxidative stress (OS), caused by an imbalance between antioxidants and reactive oxygen species
            (ROS),
            also plays a crucial role in depression, making the brain particularly vulnerable. The kynurenine pathway,
            where
            kynurenine is metabolised by microglia to neurotoxic quinolinic acid (QUIN) and by astrocytes to beneficial
            kynurenic acid (KynA), is also implicated, with QUIN increasing and KynA decreasing in MDD patients' brains.
            <br> - <b>Neuroplasticity and Structural/Functional Brain Remodelling Hypothesis:</b> Postmortem studies of
            MDD
            patients
            show reduced densities of glial cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Impairments
            of
            functional connections, synaptic atrophy, and decreased neurogenesis are believed to contribute to MDD
            symptoms.
            Astrocytic dysfunction and astrocyte dystrophy play a substantial role, leading to changes in neuronal
            structure
            and
            function under chronic stress. The hippocampus is predominantly associated with memory functions, and
            impaired
            neurogenesis in its dentate gyrus (DG) is receiving increasing attention in MDD. BDNF is fundamental in
            mediating
            neuronal survival, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, and its levels are significantly reduced in MDD.
            <br> - <b>Systemic Influence Hypothesis (Multi-organ Interactions):</b> Growing evidence suggests that MDD
            arises from
            correlational disorders of multiple systems or organs, not just the brain. This includes:
            <br> - <b>Microbiota-gut-brain axis:</b> Dysbiosis (disruption) of the gut microbiome (GMB) is clearly
            implicated, with
            microbiota alterations affecting neurotransmitter release (serotonin, dopamine), stress response (HPA axis),
            BDNF
            levels, and inflammatory cytokine release. The abundance of certain bacterial taxa is altered in MDD
            patients,
            with
            increased <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Streptococcaceae</i>, <i>Eggerthella</i>, and <i>Streptococcus</i>, and decreased
            <br> - Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Sutterellaceae</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>.
            <br> - <b>Liver dysfunction and immune system disorders</b> also play important roles. Stressful conditions
            can
            affect gut
            microbiota, leading to inflammatory mediators passing the blood-brain barrier.
            <br> - <b>Genetic and Epigenetic Anomaly Hypothesis:</b> Genetic factors play a crucial role, with MDD
            having a
            heritability
            of 30–50%. Over 100 gene loci are associated with increased MDD risk, including those related to presynaptic
            vesicle
            trafficking (PCLO), dopaminergic neurotransmission (DRD2), glutamate ionotropic receptors (GRIK5, GRM5),
            calcium
            signalling (CACNA1E, CACNA2D1), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), transcription levels of somatostatin (SST),
            and
            fatty acid desaturase (FADS).
            <br> - <b>Social Psychological Hypothesis:</b> Traumatic or stressful life events are high risks for MDD.
            <b>Cellular Interactions:</b>
            <br> - <b>Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes</b> are key glial cells involved in neuroinflammation
            and
            MDD
            pathogenesis. Postmortem studies show reduced glial cell densities in specific brain regions of MDD
            patients.
            <br> - Astrocytic dysfunction affects neuronal glutamate toxicity, and specific astrocytic receptors (like
            5-HT2B) are
            implicated.
            <br> - Microglia and astrocytes mediate innate immune responses, and peripheral immune cells can infiltrate
            the
            central
            nervous system during neuroinflammation.
            <br> - Interactions between neurons and glial cells can induce oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine
            release, and
            reduced neurotrophic factors.

        <h1>Treatment & prognosis</h1>
        <p>
            The treatment of depression typically involves a phased approach focused on recovery, preventing relapse,
            and
            preventing recurrence. MDD is a heterogeneous disease, and its pathological and pharmacological mechanisms
            are
            still
            unclear, which limits diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Many patients do not respond well to current
            antidepressants, with almost 30% not experiencing remission even after multiple treatment attempts.
            <br><br><b>Non-Pharmacological Treatments:</b>
            <br><br> - <b>Lifestyle Medicine:</b> This evolving specialty aims to prevent MDD occurrence and recurrence
            through
            interventions such as <b>improving sleep hygiene, dietary regulation, increasing physical exercise, avoiding
                sedentary behaviour, and increasing social support</b>.
            <br> - <b>Sleep improvement</b> involves behavioural and educational strategies, cognitive restructuring
            therapy, and
            circadian rhythm support. Sleep disturbances are highly linked to MDD.
            <br> - <b>Dietary adjustments</b> may prevent MDD occurrence or recurrence by regulating immune-inflammatory
            responses,
            improving the gut-microbe-brain axis, and enhancing synaptic plasticity.
            <br> - <b>Exercise</b> is effective in improving neuroplasticity, maintaining neuroendocrine homeostasis,
            and
            regulating
            neuroinflammation.
            <br> - <b>Social interventions</b> provide emotional support and improve self-awareness.
            <br><br> - <b>Psychological Treatments:</b> These are recommended for persistent depressive symptoms or MDD,
            especially in
            first-line care.
            <br> - <b>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</b> is a preferred psychotherapeutic approach, showing
            effectiveness and
            long-term durability.
            <br> - Other effective psychotherapies include behavioural activation therapy (BAT), interpersonal
            psychotherapy
            (IPT),
            Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), psychodynamic therapy
            (DYN),
            problem-solving therapy (PST), and Life review therapy (LRT).
            <br><br> - <b>Phototherapy:</b> Bright light treatment has shown efficacy, even in combination with fluoxetine,
            potentially by
            affecting serotonin turnover and visual circuits related to the habenula.
            <br><br> - <b>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):</b> This is a non-surgical brain stimulation
            technique that
            is safe and effective as an adjunctive treatment for depressed adolescents and adults.
            <br><br> - <b>Acupuncture:</b> A traditional Chinese treatment, acupuncture is cost-effective and has fewer side
            effects
            compared to pharmacological therapies. It may modulate the corticostriatal reward/motivation circuit,
            promote
            neuronal regeneration, elevate BDNF levels, regulate the CaMK signalling pathway, and increase synaptic
            transmission.
            <br><br> - <b>Gut Microbiota-targeted therapies:</b> Probiotics and synbiotics show a <b>modest benefit in
                reducing
                depressive
                symptoms</b> over four to nine weeks compared to placebo, although prebiotics did not show significant
            benefits in
            clinical trials. Further rigorous double-blind randomised controlled trials are needed to determine optimal
            species,
            dosage, and treatment length before these therapies are widely implemented.
            <br><br><b>Pharmacological Treatments:</b>
            <br><br> - <b>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):</b> <b>Citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and
                sertraline</b> are
            often the first-choice antidepressants for (young) adults and elderly patients. They work by selectively
            inhibiting
            serotonin reuptake in the synaptic cleft, impacting 5-HT signalling pathways, activating 5-HT1A receptors,
            and
            increasing BDNF expression. Long-term SSRI use can increase 5-HT transmission and affect neuroplasticity and
            neurogenesis. Astrocytic 5-HT2B receptors are considered potential pharmacological targets of SSRIs.
            Paroxetine
            and
            venlafaxine are generally not preferred in first-line care due to potential withdrawal symptoms upon
            discontinuation.
            <br><br> - <b>Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):</b> Representative SNRIs include
            <b>milnacipran,
                desvenlafaxine (DVS), duloxetine, and venlafaxine</b>. They inhibit both norepinephrine and serotonin
            reuptake,
            providing a dual mechanism of action.
            <br><br> - <b>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):</b> First approved in the late 1950s, common TCAs include
            <b>imipramine,
                amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, and doxepin</b>. They primarily inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT,
            NE,
            and to a
            lesser extent, DA, increasing neurotransmitter concentrations in the synaptic gap. They can also antagonise
            5-HT2A
            and 5-HT2C receptors, and bind to histamine (H1) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which contribute to
            their
            side effects such as sedation, dry mouth, and constipation. TCAs are generally not first-line choices due to
            more
            severe side effects.
            <br><br> - <b>Novel Therapeutic Drugs:</b>
            <br> - <b>Ketamine and its S-enantiomer, esketamine</b>, are approved for depression treatment, with
            intranasal
            esketamine
            spray showing high efficacy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Their anti-depressive effects may
            involve
            increasing BDNF levels and exerting anti-inflammatory effects.
            <br> - <b>Hydroxynorketamine (HNK)</b>, a metabolite of ketamine, also exerts antidepressant effects via an
            NMDAR-independent mechanism.
            <br> - <b>Adjunctive Therapies/Augmentation:</b>
            <br> - <b>Atypical antipsychotics</b> such as <b>aripiprazol, quetiapine, and risperidon</b> can be added to
            existing treatment
            regimens.
            <br> - <b>Lithium</b> is often used as an augmentation strategy and is effective across various
            antidepressants.
            <br> - <b>Liothyronine</b> (synthetic thyroid hormone, T3) can also be considered for augmentation.
            <br><br> - Other adjunctive treatments explored in clinical trials include <b>celecoxib</b> (reducing serum
            IL-6),
            <b>minocycline</b>, and <b>omega-3 fatty acids</b>.
            <br> - <b>Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors:</b> <b>Tranylcypromine</b> is an MAO-inhibitor that may be
            considered for
            treatment-resistant depression, though its use is complex due to drug interactions and dietary restrictions.
            Phenelzine is another MAO-inhibitor available for atypical depression characteristics.
            <br><br><b>Prognosis and Treatment Duration:</b>
            <br> - The course of MDD is variable, with some individuals experiencing chronic symptoms and others having
            long
            symptom-free periods between episodes.
            <br> - <b>Antidepressant treatment should ideally continue for at least 6 months after achieving
                remission</b>
            (or more than
            1 year for recurrent depression) to prevent relapse. Gradually discontinuing antidepressants is advised to
            reduce
            withdrawal symptoms.
            <br> - Chronicity of depressive symptoms often leads to a more refractory course and is associated with
            underlying
            personality, anxiety, and substance use disorders.
            <br> - Despite available treatments, a significant portion of MDD patients do not achieve remission,
            highlighting the
            need for further research into pharmacological and pathological mechanisms.
