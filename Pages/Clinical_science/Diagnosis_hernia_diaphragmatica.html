        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h2>Aetiologies</h2>

        <p>Most commonly, an <b>acquired diaphragmatic hernia</b> is secondary to trauma and thus diaphragmatic rupture. Thereafter, the most common cause is <b>iatrogenic</b>, notably <b>liver resections and transplants</b>.</p>

        <p>Diaphragmatic hernia is notably also a <b>congenital</b> condition, where the fetal diaphragm develops incompletely. As it allows abdominal contents to creep into the thorax, it leads to <b>abdominal lung development and persistent pulmonary hypertension</b>. This congenital defect occurs in roughly <b>25 per 100.000 live births</b>.</p>

        <h2>Embryology</h2>

        <p>The diaphragm originates from 4 main structures:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Week 4: the <b>septum transversum</b> and <b>esophageal mesentery</b> merge from respectively posterior and anterior to form a separation between thorax and abdomen</li>
            <li>Week 5: the <b>pleuroperitoneum</b> forms to cover the separating membrane</li>
            <li>Week 8: the <b>muscular structures</b> making up the diaphragm form</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Structure</h2>

        <p>The diaphragm is made up of an upward c-shaped dome dividing the thorax from the abdomen. It has <b>peripheral muscular attachments</b> which come together in a <b>central tendon</b> forming the crest of the dome. The attaching muscle is one whole, but has two distinct portions: <b>costal</b>, which is the actual driver of breathing and the <b>crural</b> which attaches the diaphragm to the lower limbs and <b>lumbar vertebrae</b>. The latter part is named such because it arises from the <b>crural and arcuate ligaments</b> which in turn arise from the lumbar vertebrae.</p>
        <p>The diaphgram has three natural openings: <b>caval hiatus</b>, <b>esophageal hiatus</b> and <b>aortic hiatus</b>. The vena cava passes through the <b>central tendon</b>, the esophagus through the <b>crural muscle</b> and the <b>aorta</b> between the ligaments. This is as good a time as any to rehearse the fact that <b>the vena cava lies anterior to the esophagus, which lies anterior to the aorta</b>.</p>
        
        <p>The following structures pass these openings at the following points:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Caval hiatus (T8): Inferior vena cava</li>
            <li>Esophageal hiatus (T10): Esophagus, vagal trunks, left gastric artery</li>
            <li>Aortic hiatus (T12): Aorta, thoracic duct, Azygous vein</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Of note is the <b>sternocostal triangle</b> or the <b>foramina of Morgagni</b> which lie between the <b>costal and sternal attachments of the thoracic diaphragm</b> and contain no structures.</p>

        <h1>Subtypes</h1>

        <h2>Based on location</h2>

        <p>Based on location, there are three types of congenital hernia diaphragmatica:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Bochdalek type: Postero-lateral costal muscle</li>
            <li>Morgagni type: Through the foramina of Morgagni</li>
            <li>Central type: Through the central tendon</li>

        </ol>

        <p>The Bochdalek type is by far the most common and in <b>80% of cases</b> occurs on the <b>left side</b>.</p>

        <h2>Based on passing structures</h2>

        <p>A <b>hiatal hernia</b> is a hernia in which abdominal organs slip through the diaphragm in to the <b>middle compartment of the chest</b>. Complications may involve <b>GERD</b> and <b>laryngopharyngeal reflux</b>. It is often associated with <b>obesity, older age, major trauma and scoliosis</b>. There are two main types:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Type I: Sliding hernia -> Here, the entire oesophageal-stomach complex slides up into the thoracic cavity. It is due to <b>widening of the muscular hiatal tunnel, and laxity of the phrenoesophageal ligament</b> which allows the gastric cardia to herniate upward</li>
            <li>Type II: Paraesophageal hernia -> Here, the fundus and greater curvature of the stomach roll up through the diaphragm. It occurs when <b>there is a local defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament</b>. Then, the fundus leads the hearniation</li>

        </ol>

        <p>A sliding type is by far the most common, representing <b>95%</b> of all hiatal herniations. In general, <b>60% of those aged 50 and over</b> have a hiatal hernia, while only <b>9% of these are symptomatic</b>. As they are common in developed areas, but not in underdeveloped ones, low fibre diets with seated toilets are possible causes.</p>
