        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Pressure injuries, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers, or pressure ulcers, are <b>localized skin and
                soft tissue injuries</b> that develop from prolonged pressure and shear, typically over bony
            prominences. While 70% of these ulcers occur at the sacrum, ischial tuberosity, and greater trochanter, they
            can also affect areas like the occiput, scapula, elbow, heel, lateral malleolus, shoulder, and ear, and can
            even arise from medical devices.
            <br><br>
            Different medical fields use various classifications for pressure injuries, with the <b>National Pressure
                Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP)</b> and the <b>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
                Related Health Problems (ICD-11)</b> providing the latest and most accepted systems. The term "pressure
            injury" is now preferred over "pressure ulcer" by the NPIAP (formerly NPUAP) to better encompass all forms
            of tissue damage, including those before visible skin breakdown. Historically, in the 19th century, French
            doctor Jean-Martin Charcot studied decubitus ulcers, terming them "decubitus ominous" due to their
            association with inevitable death.
        </p>

        <h1>Etiology</h1>
        <p>
            The development of pressure injuries is <b>complex and multifactorial</b>, involving both external and
            internal factors.
            <br> - <b>External factors</b> include prolonged pressure, friction, shear force, and moisture, which lead
            to tissue deformation and ischemia.
            <br> - <b>Internal factors</b> such as malnutrition, anemia, and endothelial dysfunction can accelerate
            tissue damage.
            <br><br>
            The most common risk factors are decreased mobility, skin moisture, poor nutritional status, and loss of
            sensory perception. Older age, cognitive impairment, and comorbid conditions affecting tissue healing also
            contribute to risk.
            <br><br>
            Prolonged pressure on tissues can occlude capillary beds, reducing oxygen levels and leading to the
            accumulation of toxic metabolites, which ultimately causes tissue ulceration and necrosis. Just two hours of
            immobility can initiate a decubitus ulcer in a bedridden patient or during surgery. Dysfunction of nervous
            regulatory mechanisms that regulate local blood flow can also be a factor.
            <br><br>
            Patients with certain conditions show a predisposition to decubitus ulcers, including:
            <br> - Neurologic disease
            <br> - Cardiovascular disease
            <br> - Prolonged anesthesia
            <br> - Dehydration
            <br> - Malnutrition
            <br> - Hypotension
            <br> - Surgical patients
        </p>

        <h1>Epidemiology</h1>
        <p>
            Pressure ulcers constitute a <b>significant global healthcare problem</b>, affecting millions annually in
            the United States alone. Their management imposes a substantial economic burden, with hospital-acquired
            pressure injury (HAPI) costs estimated to exceed $26.8 billion in 2019. The incidence of HAPI can be as high
            as 8.3 per 100 acutely ill patients.
            <br><br>
            Sacral decubitus ulcers are particularly common in elderly, incontinent, paralyzed, or debilitated patients.
            <b>Patients with normal sensory status, mobility, and mental status are less likely to develop these
                ulcers</b> because their physiological feedback systems prompt frequent positional shifts. Two-thirds of
            ulcers occur in patients older than 70 years, and some data indicate that 83% of hospitalized patients
            develop ulcers within five days of hospitalization.
        </p>

        <h1>Pathophysiology</h1>
        <p>
            Though multifactorial, decubitus ulcer formation consistently leads to ischemia and necrosis. The primary
            cause is <b>constant external pressure exerted over a prolonged period</b>, which must exceed the arterial
            capillary pressure (32 mm Hg) to impede blood flow and the venous capillary closing pressure (8 to 12 mm Hg)
            to impair venous blood return. Sustained pressure above these values results in tissue ischemia and
            necrosis. This pressure can stem from firm mattresses, hospital bed railings, or any hard surface in contact
            with the patient.
            <br><br>
            The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) has linked the pathophysiology of COVID-19 to pressure
            ulcer development, attributing it to pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis
            factor-alpha, which are abundant in COVID-19 patients and contribute to inflammation and cell death.
            Friction (skin rubbing against surfaces) can also contribute by breaking superficial skin layers, and
            moisture can cause or worsen ulcers through tissue breakdown and maceration.
        </p>

        <h1>Histopathology</h1>
        <p>Histological studies reveal a dynamic process, starting with blanchable and non-blanchable erythema,
            progressing to decubitus dermatitis, decubitus ulcer, and eventually black scab/gangrene. Initial changes
            occur in the papillary dermis vessels, followed by necrosis of skin structures. A scab or gangrene indicates
            a full-thickness defect due to persistent ischemia, anoxemia, or sudden occlusion from shear injury. Chronic
            pressure ulcers often show <b>densely aggregated bacterial colonies</b> in the extracellular matrix, a
            finding typically absent in acutely developed ulcers. Interestingly, exposed bone in sacral pressure ulcers
            shows a low incidence of osteomyelitis, and when present, it is usually focal and restricted to superficial
            cortical bone layers.</p>

        <h1>History and Physical</h1>
        <p>
            Patients with pressure ulcers often lack normal sensation, mobility, and mental status, making them unaware
            of their injuries. <b>An attendant typically reports the injury</b>, which may present with pus or blood
            discharge staining clothes or bedsheets. Clinical presentation varies across body sites due to differing
            resistance of skin, soft tissue, and muscle to external pressure. The most common locations are the sacrum,
            ischial tuberosity, and greater trochanter, but others include the occiput, scapula, elbow, heel, lateral
            malleolus, shoulder, and ear. Muscle ischemia and necrosis can occur before skin breakdown, potentially
            misleading clinicians about the ulcer's true depth or extent.
            <br><br>
            A <b>thorough history and overall patient assessment are paramount</b>. Clinicians should evaluate any
            neurological or cardiovascular disease, as these increase predictive risk and decrease healing potential.
            Nutritional and hydration status, cognitive impairment, and mobility should also be assessed.
            <br><br>
            Key historical information to gather includes:
            <br> - Duration of immobility or being bedridden.
            <br> - Duration of hospital stay.
            <br> - Associated medical causes (e.g., paraplegia, quadriplegia, stroke, road traffic accident).
            <br> - Natural history of the injury, including the initial site, duration, and any size increases.
            <br> - History of systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and malignancy,
            which hinder wound healing.
            <br> - Patient's ability to localize pain or sensation at the ulcer site, or lack thereof due to conditions
            like paraplegia.
            <br> - Presence of discharge or foul odor from the ulcer site.
        </p>

        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <p>
            When evaluating a patient with a pressure injury, examine the following:
            <br> - Ulcer history, including etiology, duration, and previous treatment.
            <br> - <b>Staging</b>, involving a thorough examination of wound depth.
            <br> - Size of the affected area.
            <br> - Presence of sinus tracts, undermining, and tunneling.
            <br> - Presence of drainage.
            <br> - Presence of necrotic tissue.
            <br><br>
            Risk assessment instruments are important for reducing the incidence of pressure injuries. The <b>Braden
                Scale</b> is the most common and accepted in current literature. It assesses six areas:
            <br> - <b>Sensory perception</b> (1-4: completely limited to no impairment)
            <br> - <b>Mobility</b> (1-4: completely immobile to no limitations)
            <br> - <b>Moisture</b> (1-4: constantly moist to rarely moist)
            <br> - <b>Nutrition</b> (1-4: very poor to excellent)
            <br> - <b>Activity</b> (1-4: bedfast to walks frequently)
            <br> - <b>Friction and Shear</b> (1-3: problem to no apparent problem)
            <br><br>
            The sum of points provides a risk assessment score:
            <br> - Mild Risk = 15 to 18
            <br> - Moderate Risk = 13 to 14
            <br> - High Risk = 10 to 12
            <br> - Very High Risk = 9 or below

        <h1>Treatment / Management</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Prevention intervention is considered the best treatment</b> for pressure ulcers. This involves
            maintaining and improving tissue tolerance and appropriate offloading through:
            <br> <b>Excellent skincare</b>, ensuring skin is clean and dry.
            <br> <b>Adequate hydration and nutrition</b>; nutritional supplements may be beneficial for patients with
            limited oral intake.
            <br> <b>Pressure dispersion cushions</b>, turning schedules, and support surfaces. Turning every 4 hours on
            a viscoelastic foam mattress/surface has been shown to result in fewer pressure ulcers than turning every 2
            hours on a standard mattress. Support surfaces should be selected based on risk level, ulcer stage,
            mobility, patient comfort, and microclimate control.
            <br><br>
            Once a pressure ulcer forms, management involves:
            <br> - <b>Actively offloading</b> the affected anatomical area.
            <br> - Ensuring <b>adequate drainage</b> if an infection is present.
            <br> - <b>Debriding devitalized tissue</b>.
            <br> - Providing <b>optimal wound care</b>.
            <br><br>
            Pressure redistribution can be achieved through active patient repositioning, immersive beds, special
            dressings, and refitting prosthetics. Drainage is performed for abscesses. <b>Topical agents</b> like
            iodine, silver sulfadiazine, hydrogen peroxide, or Dakin solution can be applied temporarily for suspected
            infections, but long-term use can hinder wound healing. <b>Antibiotics</b> are reserved for significant
            cellulitis or systemic infection signs. Even with exposed bone in sacral decubitus ulcers, studies indicate
            a low incidence of osteomyelitis.
            <br><br>
            <b>Mechanical debridement</b> is generally necessary to remove devitalized tissue and biofilms that prevent
            wound healing, but it is not recommended for dry eschar without purulence or fluctuance. <b>Dressings</b>
            vary by ulcer stage, infection, and exudate. The NPIAP recommends <b>foam silicone dressings</b>. A
            comprehensive program using Allevyn Life silicone adhesive dressing for PIs with a Braden score of 14 or
            less significantly reduced hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.
            <br><br>
            An <b>algorithm for dressing selection</b> is based on the presence of infection and the amount of exudate:
            <br> <b>If the wound is infected:</b>
            <br> - None exudate: Use silver, honey, foam.
            <br> - Some exudate: Use alginate, negative pressure wound therapy, silver, gauze, foam.
            <br> - Copious exudate: Use alginate, negative pressure wound therapy, gauze, foam.
            <br> <b>If the wound is not infected:</b>
            <br> - None exudate: Use hydrogel, transparent film.
            <br> - Some exudate: Use alginate, hydrocolloid, negative pressure wound therapy, gauze, foam.
            <br> - Copious exudate: Use alginate, hydrocolloid, negative pressure wound therapy, gauze, foam.
            <br><br>
            <b>Surgical management</b> may be necessary depending on ulcer depth and severity, and urinary and fecal
            diversion might be required for specific ulcer sites prone to contamination. Preoperatively, ulcers are
            cleaned and drained, and vacuum-assisted closure or negative pressure wound therapy can prepare the wound
            for surgical closure. The goal of surgery is to fill dead space and provide durable skin through flap
            reconstruction. Ideal surgical candidates have stage 1 or 2 wounds without purulence, a well-granulated
            base, and a region protected from soiling; their nutritional status (Prealbumin levels), diabetes control,
            and absence of acute medical conditions should be assessed.
            <br><br>
            Surgical treatment options include:
            <br> - <b>Surgical debridement</b> to remove devitalized, infected tissue or bone.
            <br> - <b>Skin graft</b>, although they have high failure rates in later stages due to low long-term
            durability.
            <br> - <b>Pedicle muscle, myocutaneous, fasciocutaneous flaps, or free flaps</b>, with the choice depending
            on anatomical location, need for ambulation, and comorbidities.
            <br><br>
            <b>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</b> can aid wound healing by improving oxygenation. Generally, <b>stage 1 and 2
                ulcers do not require operative measures</b>, while <b>stage 3 and 4 ulcers may require surgical
                intervention</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Supplementing on Support Surfaces (from):</b>
            The effective use of support surfaces is critical for pressure ulcer prevention and control. These include
            specially-designed beds, mattresses, mattress overlays, and cushions that protect vulnerable areas and
            distribute pressure more evenly. Despite their importance, attention to support surfaces has been
            insufficient in nursing practices, with a low utilization rate and often inappropriate selection based on
            ulcer stage or site.
            <br><br>
            <b>Assessment for Support Surface Selection</b> is vital and depends on the patient's condition and the site
            of potential or existing injury.
            <br> <b>For prone support surfaces, assessment should consider:</b>
            <br> - Degree of mobility and activity restriction.
            <br> - Need for controlled microenvironment and shear reduction.
            <br> - Patient's body size and weight.
            <br> - Number, severity, and location of existing pressure injuries, and risk of new ones.
            <br> - Acute onset of illness, serious illness, diabetes, major surgery, or spinal cord injury.
            <br> - Patient comfort, satisfaction, economic conditions, and cost.
            <br> <b>For seated support surfaces, assessment should consider:</b>
            <br> - Body type and physique.
            <br> - Effect of posture and deformity on pressure redistribution.
            <br> - Activity and lifestyle needs.
            <br> <b>For heel support surfaces, assessment is needed if any of the following conditions apply:</b>
            <br> - Braden score ≤13, or sub-entry with activity and/or mobility ≤2.
            <br> - Lower limb mobility loss, inability to lift legs, muscle strength below grade 3.
            <br> - Presence of a pressure ulcer to the heel.
            <br> <b>For intraoperative support surfaces, assessment should consider:</b>
            <br> - Surgery duration and surgical position.
            <br> - Specific requirements for instrumentation and stability of the surgical area.
            <br><br>
            <b>Recommendations for the Use of Support Surfaces:</b>
            <br> <b>For Pressure Ulcer Prevention:</b>
            <br> - Patients at risk (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) should use a <b>high-specification
                induction single-layer foam mattress or bedspread</b> instead of non-high-specification foam mattresses.
            <br> - During surgery in the prone position, <b>pressure redistribution support surfaces</b> (e.g., facial
            pads, chest pads) or postural devices are recommended to relieve pressure points.
            <br> - <b>Pressure redistribution cushions</b> are recommended for high-risk patients who require prolonged
            chair or wheelchair use, especially those unable to perform pressure reduction.
            <br> - <b>Heel support devices</b> designed to relieve pressure on the heel, such as heel suspension boots
            or long foam pads, are recommended.
            <br> - For patients where regular pressure repositioning is not possible, <b>alternating pressure
                mattresses</b> are recommended to shorten local pressure time, reduce friction and shear force, and
            improve local blood circulation.
            <br> - In low-cost or power-unavailable settings, a <b>static air mattress combined with turning every four
                hours</b> can effectively disperse pressure, provide cushioning, enhance comfort, and ease operation.
            <br> - <b>Air-jet airbeds are not recommended</b> due to difficulty controlling air pressure relative to
            patient weight.
            <br> - <b>Foam rings and donut-type support surfaces are not recommended</b> for intraoperative prone
            position.
            <br> <b>For Pressure Ulcer Management (existing ulcers):</b>
            <br> - For patients with early pressure ulcers, <b>dynamic alternating decompression inflatable
                mattresses</b> are recommended to change pressure, promote blood circulation, and speed healing.
            <br> - For Stage II pressure ulcer patients, <b>high specification reactive foam mattresses, non-dynamic
                pressure redistribution mattresses, or viscoelastic foam mattresses</b> are recommended; viscoelastic
            foam mattresses can also be used during surgical procedures.
            <br> - For patients with Class III or IV/Stage pressure injuries, an <b>airflow bed or low air loss
                mattress</b> is recommended to promote healing while reducing skin temperature and excessive hydration.
            <br> - <b>Alternating pressure cushions</b> are recommended for chair or wheelchair-bound patients with
            pressure ulcers who cannot perform pressure reduction.
            <br> - For patients at risk of heel pressure ulcers or with Stage I or II heel pressure ulcers, <b>elevating
                the heel with a specially designed heel support device or pillow/foam pad</b> is recommended to
            completely relieve pressure and avoid Achilles tendon/popliteal vein compression.
            <br><br>
            Despite these recommendations, the effectiveness of some support surfaces, like alternating pressure
            inflatable mattresses, remains controversial in current research due to limited and conflicting evidence.
            Further high-quality studies are needed to clearly define and report outcomes such as patient comfort,
            quality of life, and cost analysis, and to minimize bias through robust study design, including blinding
            where possible.

        <h1>Staging</h1>
        <p>
            There are various ways to stage pressure ulcers globally, but their conceptual meanings are comparable. The
            <b>NPIAP system is the most widely accepted classification in the United States</b>, classifying ulcers by
            depth.
            The stages are:
            <br> - <b>Stage 1:</b> Skin is intact with <b>nonblanchable erythema</b>.
            <br> - <b>Stage 2:</b> Partial-thickness skin loss involving the <b>epidermis and dermis</b>.
            <br> - <b>Stage 3:</b> Full-thickness skin loss extending to the <b>subcutaneous tissue but not crossing the
                fascia</b> beneath it; slough or eschar may be visible, and the lesion may be foul-smelling.
            <br> - <b>Stage 4:</b> Full-thickness skin loss extending <b>through the fascia with considerable tissue
                loss</b>; may involve muscle, bone, tendon, or joint.
            <br> - <b>Unstageable:</b> The depth is unknown because <b>slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue
                damage</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)</b> is another category under NPIAP guidelines, occurring due to prolonged
            pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. It presents as intact or non-intact skin with
            persistent, non-blanched, deep red, maroon, or purple discoloration, and should not describe vascular,
            traumatic, neuropathic, or dermatologic injuries.
        </p>

        <h1>Prognosis</h1>
        <p>
            The prognosis for patients with pressure ulcers varies based on anatomical location, injury stage, and
            treatment regimen. Healing rates after 6 months are documented to be over 70% for Stage 2, about 50% for
            Stage 3, and approximately 30% for Stage 4. Recurrence rates vary by anatomical location, with sacral ulcers
            having the highest recurrence (57%), followed by ischial (14%), trochanteric (7%), calcaneus (7%), and
            others (14%).
            <br><br>
            Factors affecting prognosis include:
            <br> - Advancing age
            <br> - Size and stage of the pressure injury
            <br> - Nutritional status
            <br> - Chronic comorbidities
            <br><br>
            Individuals with a higher mean body mass index (BMI), higher mean hemoglobin, and those undergoing
            reconstructive plastic surgical procedures have shown better pressure ulcer healing rates. It is generally
            agreed that lifelong treatment and prevention measures are often necessary for these patients.
        </p>

        <h1>Complications</h1>
        <p>
            Complications are common with decubitus ulcers, with <b>infection being the most frequent problem</b>. Grade
            3 and 4 ulcers require intensive management as their complications can be life-threatening. Microbial
            analysis reveals the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the lesions. If infection spreads to
            deeper tissues and bone, it can lead to periostitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and sinus formation,
            potentially resulting in fatal septicemia in already debilitated patients.
            <br><br>
            These wounds are catabolic, causing severe fluid and protein loss, which can result in hypoproteinemia or
            malnutrition (up to 50 grams of body protein can be lost daily). Chronic decubitus ulcers can also lead to
            chronic anemia or secondary amyloidosis, with anemia sometimes occurring secondary to chronic water loss and
            bleeding. Postoperative complications from reconstructive surgery can include hematoma or seroma formation,
            wound dehiscence, abscess formation, or postoperative wound sepsis.
            <br><br>
            Pressure injuries are strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality, with older patients
            experiencing a 3.6-fold increased mortality rate within 21 months compared to those without a pressure
            injury. However, the literature debates whether this is causation or correlation, suggesting that the same
            comorbidities increasing the risk of death also increase the chance of developing a pressure injury.
        </p>

        <h1>Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care</h1>
        <p>
            Postoperative care involves reinforcing the same risk factors that were addressed before surgery, including
            <b>offloading, sufficient skincare, incontinence control, and maintaining nutritional status</b>. Medical
            staff must avoid excessive shearing and stretch on skin flaps when transferring patients from the operating
            table to air-fluid beds.
            <br><br>
            Patients are typically positioned flat on support surfaces for the first four weeks after surgery, gradually
            progressing to a semi-sitting position, and then to sitting for 10 minutes after six weeks, increasing
            incrementally to two hours over two weeks. Patients are also taught to lift for 10 seconds every 10 minutes
            to relieve pressure. A successful postoperative care plan requires agreement from the patient, family
            members, and social support team. Inpatient rehabilitation or a skilled nursing facility is recommended if
            the patient lacks good social support at home.
        </p>

        <h1>Deterrence and Patient Education</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Preventing recurrence requires commitment and responsibility</b> from patients and their families.
            Education is crucial for managing the condition both in the hospital and at home. Patients should be
            familiar with warning signs such as skin discoloration, ulceration, discharge, a foul smell from the ulcer
            site, and body areas with decreased or no sensation.
            <br><br>
            Diets for patients with pressure injuries should include <b>adequate amounts of protein, vitamins, and
                minerals</b>. Patients should move or turn every four hours, seeking help if they cannot do so
            independently. The use of air or water mattresses at home is recommended, as active mattress use
            significantly improves resting blood flow, post-occlusive reactive hyperemia, and baseline skin temperature,
            suggesting improved endothelial function.
        </p>

        <h1>Pearls and Other Issues</h1>
        <p>Pressure injuries result from prolonged pressure combined with friction and shear force. They vary in size,
            depth, and chronicity. A <b>staging classification system aids interprofessional team communication and
                guides treatment</b>. Consulting with a clinician is vital for guiding treatment and achieving better
            results.</p>
