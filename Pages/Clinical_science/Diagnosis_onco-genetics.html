        <h1>Types of syndromes</h1>
        <p>The ICD-11 describes a number of syndromes of the code for genetic syndromes which predispose for the development of tumours. If we divide those up into classes, we might get something like this:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Tumour suppressor gene syndromes</li>
            <li>DNA repair and genomic stability syndromes</li>
            <li>Developmenetal and RAS/MAPK pathway syndromes</li>
        </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Tumour suppressor gene syndromes</h1>

        <p>To offer a quick recap: tumour suppressor genes are those genes that act as cellular "brakes", <b>inhibiting cell growth, division and survival</b>. They help maintain controlled cell proliferation and respond to abnormal cell behaviours by triggering <b>apoptosis</b> or halting the cell cycle to prevent further division. They do so <b>by monitoring signals and checkpoints during cell division</b>. Famous examples are for example <b>p53 (a.k.a. the "guardian of the genome"), RB1 and APC</b>. Certain genes have a dual function, notably <b>BRCA1/BRCA2</b> which are also responsible for DNA repair.</p>
    
        <p>Syndromes which fall into this category are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Gardner syndrome</li>
            <li>Neurofibromatosis type 2</li>
            <li>Tuberous sclerosis complex</li>
            <li>Gorlin syndrome</li>
            <li>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Certain syndromes fall within multiple categories, namely <b>inherited breast and ovarian-cancer</b>, <b>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome</b> and <b>Neurofibromatosis type 1</b>.</p>
        
        <h2>Gardner syndrome</h2>
        <p><b>Gardner's syndrome</b>, a type of familial adenomatous polyposis, is a autosomal dominant form of polyposis. Typically, it consists of <b>multiple colon polyps, as well as extracolonic tumours such as osteomas of the skull, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts and fibromas</b>. A rare occurance which is seen more frequently in Gardner's syndrome is <b>desmoid tumours</b>. There is notably no cure, and since the polyps may number into the hundreds to thousands, it is often a terminal diagnosis with a life-expectancy of <b>35-45 years</b>.</p>
        <p>It is caused by the <b>APG gene</b>, a tumour suppressor. As of late, it is considered a phenotypical variant of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) which predisposes for colon cancer.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic"><b>Gardner's</b> syndrome makes the colon look like a <b>garden</b></div>

        <h2>Neurofibromatosis type 2</h2>
        <p><b>MISME or Multiple Inherited Schwannomas, Meningiomas, and Ependymomas</b> refers to a genetic condition causing <b>benign tumours of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves</b>. Typical for NF2/MISMe are <b>vestibular Schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas</b> which cause hearing loss. Treatment typically consists of neurosurgical removal of the tumours and laesions.</p>
        <p>A cause is found in the so-called <b>Merlin gene</b> a tumour suppressor, named as an acronym and not after the mythological character.</p>

        <h2>Schwannomatosis / NF type 3</h2>
        <p>Schwannomatosis is an extremely rare genetic condition originally described in japanese patients. Typically, it consists of <b>multiple cutaneous Schwannomas, central nervous system tumours and other neurological complications without typical NF symptoms</b>. It is thought that the frequency is around <b>1 per 1.7 million</b>.</p>
        <p>The cause of NF III is a mutation in <b>SMARCB1</b>, a tumour suppressor gene.</p>

        <h2>Tuberous sclerosis complex</h2>
        <p><b>TSC</b> is a rare (10:100,000) multisystem autosomal dominant genetic condition which causes <b>non-cancerous tumours in the brain, kidneys, heart liver, eyes, lungs and skin</b>. Consequently, a patient may experience seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioural problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease and kidney disease. Pathophysiologically, the formation of <b>hamartia and hamartomas</b>, benign growths, are responsible for the symptoms. Most, over 90%, develop neuropsychiatric and skin disorders. Typical skin symptoms are <b>hypomelanic macules called <u>"ash leaf spots"</u>, facial angiofibromas and ungual fibromas called <u>"Koenen's tumours</u></b>.</p>
        <p>TSC is caused by two tumour growth suppressors called <b>TSC1</b> and <b>TSC2</b> which codefor hamartin and tuberin respectively. It was first descibed by <b>Bourneville</b> in <b>1880</b> and in French is still referred to by this name.</p>

        <h2>Gorlin syndrome</h2>
        <p><b>NBCSS</b> or <b>Nevoid Basal-Cell Carcionoma Syndrome</b> also called <b>Gorlin syndrome</b> after <b>Robert J. Gorlin</b> is a rare inherited condition where people develop benign growths in skin, nervous system, eyes, endocrine system and bones. Most develop <b>multile basal-cell carinomas (BCCs)</b>, which is typical for the disease. Other typical smptoms are <b>odontogenic keratocyst (benign tumour of the jaw), pitted soles and handpalms, skeletal abnormalities, facial abnormalities, bilateral ovarian fibromas, cardiac fibormas, ocular findings and meningiomas</b>.</p>
        <p>NBCSS is inherited autosomal dominant, with the cause being <b>PTCH1</b>, a tumour suppressor gene.</p>

        <h2>Li-Fraumeni Syndrome</h2>
        <p><b>LFS</b> predisposes for cancer development, characterised by early onset of cancer with a wide variety of types and development of multiple types throughout one's lifetime. Classical are <b>sarcoma, breastcancer, CNS cancer, and adrenal cancer</b>.</p>
        <p>Regarded as the most important tumour suppressor gene, LFS is caused by a mutation in <b>TP53</b>.</p>

        <h2>DNA repair and genomic stability syndromes</h2>

        <p>Throughout our lives, defects in our DNA arise from normal cell division or external sources such as UV light or chemicals. <b>DNA repair genes</b> ensure genetic stability by fixing these errors, preventing the accumulation of mutations and hence the formation of tumours. There exist four types of DNA repair: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Base Excision Repair: Small, non-helix distorting base laesions</li>
            <li>Nucleotide Excision Repair: Bulky, helix-distorting laesions (notably from UV-light)</li>
            <li>Mismatch Repair: Base mismatches during DNA replication</li>
            <li>Homologous Recombination Repair: Double-strand breaks in DNA</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Notable examples of tumour suppressor genes which cause tumours when broken are <b>BRCA1/BRCA2 (Homologous Recombination Repair, cause breast and ovarian-cancer), MLH1/2/6 (Mismatch repair, cause Lynch syndrome), and XPA/XPC (Nucleotide excision repair, cause xeroderma pigmentosum)</b>. </p>
    
        <p>Notable examples of syndromes in this category then are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Xeroderma pigmentosum</li>
            <li>Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome</li>
            <li>Lynch syndrome</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Xeroderma pigmentosum</h3>
        <p><b>XP</b> is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from a <b>decreased ability to deal with UV light damage</b>. Subsequently, it presents as <b>a severe sunburn after a few minutes in the sun, freckling, dry skin and changes in pigmentation</b>. Additionally, one may find <b>hearing loss, poor coordination, intellectual disability and hearing loss</b>. As expected, skin cancer is incredibly common, with nearly 50% of patients developing such by the age of 10; as are cataracts. Treatment consists on sun protection in the form of clothing, behavioural adaptation and sunscreen; where retinoid creams may help prevent the risk of skin cancer. Epidemiology differs strongly per region, being <b>1 in 430,000 in Europe</b> and <b>1 in 370 in India</b>.</p>
        <p>Different subtypes of XR are caused by <b>different genetic mutations</b> but they all have in common that they decrease the ability to perform <b>nucleotide excision repair</b>, which is the type of repair needed after large-scale damage typical for UV-damage.</p>

        <h3>Hereditary breast and overian cancer syndrome</h3>
        <p><b>HBOC</b> is a cancer syndrome producing breast and ovarian cancer. It is common, accounting for <b>90% of all hereditary cancers</b>. While the acronym HBOC refers to female-specific cancers, both sexes have the same rate of gene mutations and HBOC is able to predispose for other types of cancer. Hence, the name <b>King syndrome</b> is becoming more common, named after the geneticist who first described the syndrome.</p>
        <p>A common condiiton, it is usually caused by <b>BRCA 1 or 2</b> but may be caused by other genes such as <b>TP53, MLH1/2/6 or PTEN</b></p>

        <h2>Lynch syndrome</h2>
        <p><b>Lynch syndrome or Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC)</b> is a syndrome giving <b>hereditary predisposition to colon cancer</b>. Beyond colon cancer, it predisposes for many other types of cancer of the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system and brain.</p>
        <p>The cause is related to various <b>MSH</b> genes such as 1, 2 and 6. Together, these are responsible for DNA mismatch repair. Over time, this disrepair causes single nucleotide changes and macrosatellilte instability.</p>

        <h1>Developmental and RAS/MAPK pathway syndromes</h1>

        <p>The <b>RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway</b> is a critical signaling pathway responsible for <b>cellular growth, division, differentiation and survival</b>. It starts by <b>growth factors or hormones</b> binding to <b>receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)</b> which autophosphorylise to effectuate downstream signaling molecules. They then activate adaptor proteins, which call a nucleotide exchange factor called <b>SOS</b> to the cell membrane, which in turns activates <b>RAS (a.k.a. KRAS)</b> by binding it to GTP. In turn, RAS actives <b>RAF (a.k.a. MAP3K or BRAF)</b>. This then phosphorylates <b>MEK</b>, which ethen activates <b>ERK (a.k.a. MAPK)</b> which poses the last step in the cascade, by translocating into the nucleous. There, ERK activates various nuclear and cytoplasmic targets which regulate gene expression involved in cell cycle progression, survival and differentiation.</p>
        <p>When mutations occur which cause cancer, these mutations are often seen keeping the pathway <b>continuously "on"</b> and hence pushing growth and survival. Common mutations are seen in the RAS and RAF parts of the cascade:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>KRAS -> Pancreatic, lung and colorectal cancers</li>
            <li>BRAF -> Melanoma and thyroid cancer</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Notable examples of syndromes in this category are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Noonan syndrome</li>
            <li>Neurofibromatosis type 1</li>
            <li>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Noonan syndrome</h2>
        <p>As a condition characterised by <b>hypertelorism (i.e., wide-set eyes), a large head, epicanthal folds, ptosis, proptosis, strabismus, micrognathia, neck webbing, cubitus valgus etc.</b> it is not immediately an oncological syndrome. However, looking at the skin we see <b>lymphedema, keloid formation, hyperkeratosis and pigmented naevi</b>. Furthermore, it is the most common syndromic cause of congential heart disease with the typical defect being <b>pulmonary valve stenosis in 50-60%</b>. Neurologically, typical NS patients eexhibit a broad range of defects with around 20% showing cognitive impairment.</p>
        <p>The cause of NS is located in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway with mutations in KRAS being common.</p>
    
        <h2>Neurofibromatosis type I</h2>
        <p><b>NF1</b> is <b>one of the most common genetic disorders</b> and is inhereted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Typical are <b>café-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, scoliosis, learning disabilities, and epilepsy</b>. Presentation, however, varies wildly and produces a variety of phenotypes. Usually, visual signs of NF-1 are present at birth but many <u>symptoms</u> only become apparent later.</p>
        <p>The cause is a gene called <b>NF-1</b>, which codes for <b>neurofibromin</b> which is needed for functioning in many human cell because of it's role in the functioning of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway.</p>
    
        <h2>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome</h2>
        <p>Typical for <b>PJS</b> is the development of <b>benign, hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, and hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa</b>. Together with <b>Gardner syndrome</b>, it falls under the family of <b>polyposis syndromes</b>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Von Hippel-Lindau disease</h1>
        <p>A disease not falling within any category is the rare <b>VHL</b> which is caused by a mutation in a gene of the same name, causing cells to produce their own growth factors. Clinically, this disease presents as <b>various cysts of the visceral organs, cerebellar/spinal and retinal hemangioblastomas and pheochromocytoma</b>. Early recognition is key, as subsequent consequences of especially the retinal angioblastomas may be prevented. Epidemiologically we see an incidence of <b>1 in 36,000 births</b> with the average age at diagnosis being <b>26 y/o</b>.</p>
