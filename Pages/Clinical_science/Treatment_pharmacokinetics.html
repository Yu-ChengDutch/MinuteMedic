        <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
        <p>
            Pharmacokinetics describes the processes a substance undergoes in the body, primarily focusing on the
            <b>active
                substance in a medicine</b>. These processes also apply to excipients, preservatives, and food
            components. A
            special mention is made for <b>prodrugs</b>, which are inactive substances that become active only after
            metabolism in the intestinal wall and/or liver. The core processes of pharmacokinetics are <b>absorption,
                distribution, metabolism, and excretion</b>. Metabolism and excretion are often grouped together as
            <b>elimination</b>. Pharmacokinetics establishes relationships between these processes and time, using
            mathematical formulas to approximate them, which allows for insights and predictions in practice. For
            instance,
            PK formulas can predict how drug concentration depends on dose, administration form, and the body's
            condition.

        <h1><b>Het gedrag van het geneesmiddel in het lichaam (The behavior of the drug in the body)</b></h1>
        <p>
            This section discusses the general behavior of a drug in the body and explains key concepts and definitions.
            It
            also addresses changes in drug pharmacokinetics due to organ dysfunction or diseases.
            <br><br>
            A drug contains one or more active substances in a specific dosage form. Sometimes, an inactive substance
            (prodrug) is included that becomes active after metabolic conversion in the body. The dosage form helps
            deliver
            the active substance to the correct location in the body.
            <br><br> <b>Lokale toediening (Local administration)</b>: If the site of action (receptor) is reasonably
            accessible from outside the body, the active substance is applied locally, close to its working site.
            Examples
            include topical creams, eye/ear/nose drops, inhalers, rectal preparations (enemas, tablets, suppositories
            for
            local action), and local anesthetics.
            <br><br> <b>Systemische toediening (Systemic administration)</b>: If direct application to the site of
            action is
            not possible, the circulatory system is used to transport the substance. Examples include various oral forms
            (tablets, capsules, liquids), parenteral forms (intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, epidural,
            intrathecal), rectal (suppository, enema), sublingual, nasal sprays, and transdermal patches.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Absorptie (Absorption)</b></h2>
        <p>
            For systemic action, intravenous administration directly introduces the drug into circulation, chosen for
            rapid
            effect or when other routes are unavailable. For other routes, the active substance must be released from
            the
            dosage form and dissolve to move into circulation. This uptake into circulation is called <b>absorption</b>.
            It
            usually occurs via <b>passive diffusion</b>, sometimes facilitated diffusion, or active transport via an
            <b>influx-transporter</b>.
            <br><br> <b>Snelheid van absorptie (Speed of absorption)</b>: This depends on the dosage form,
            administration
            route, and physicochemical properties of the active substance. For example, a solid dosage form will enter
            circulation slower than a dissolved form because it requires time for disintegration and dissolution.
            Special
            dosage forms exist for prolonged, delayed, or controlled release. If the drug diffuses quickly from blood to
            tissues after absorption, the absorption speed determines the onset of action. A higher absorption speed can
            lead to side effects due to a rapid rise in plasma concentration, especially for drugs with a narrow
            therapeutic
            window. For chronically administered drugs, slow absorption is often beneficial as it reduces plasma
            concentration fluctuations. <b>Tmax</b> is the average time a drug needs to reach its maximum plasma
            concentration (Cmax).
            <br><br> <b>Mate van absorptie (Extent of absorption)</b>: This is a crucial kinetic parameter that partly
            determines <b>bioavailability</b>. Bioavailability (F) indicates the fraction of the administered active
            substance that ultimately reaches systemic circulation and becomes available for action, relative to an
            intravenous administration of the same dose. F ranges from 0 (no drug available) to 1 (all drug available).
            Loss
            (1-F) can occur due to incomplete release from the dosage form, partial absorption (e.g., active transport
            back
            to the GI lumen via an <b>efflux-transporter</b>), or breakdown in the GI tract and/or liver during the
            <b>first-pass effect</b>.
            <br> The extent of absorption and bioavailability can vary between different dosage forms and even between
            brand-name and generic drugs. F values can help estimate necessary dose adjustments when switching dosage
            forms.
            <br> Bioavailability can also vary significantly <b>inter-individually</b> (between persons) or
            <b>intra-individually</b> (within the same person), especially with a larger first-pass effect or when food
            influences absorption. Such variations can lead to fluctuating plasma concentrations, affecting drug
            efficacy
            and requiring extra attention to clinical effect, action, and side effects. The source mentions if such
            variations are common for a drug and if its bioavailability (F) is known. F is equal to the ratio of the
            "area
            under the curve" (AUC) of plasma concentration vs. time after oral administration compared to intravenous
            administration (which is 100% bioavailable).
        </p>

        <h2><b>Distributie (Distribution)</b></h2>
        <p>
            For a drug to be effective, it must reach its site of action (bio-phase). After entering systemic
            circulation,
            several processes begin: <b>distribution in the blood, binding to plasma proteins</b> (albumin, α1-acid
            glycoprotein) or erythrocytes, <b>diffusion into extravascular tissues</b>, and <b>binding to tissue
                components</b>. Elimination processes (metabolism and excretion) also continue. The extent and manner of
            these processes depend on the drug's physicochemical properties and the patient's physical condition.
            <br><br> <b>Passive diffusion</b> underlies many of these processes.
            <br><br> <b>Protein binding</b> plays a significant role; high protein binding means most of the drug stays
            in
            plasma, with only the unbound fraction diffusing and being effective. Protein binding is noted in drug texts
            if
            it's ≥ 90% due to clinical relevance in drug interactions.
            <br><br> <b>Transporters</b> are also involved, such as at the blood-brain barrier.
            <br><br> Distribution is generally <b>heterogeneous</b>. Lipophilic substances tend to bind more to fat and
            brain tissue.
            <br><br> The <b>apparent (or fictive) volume of distribution (Vd)</b> is a measure of drug distribution in
            the
            body. It relates the amount of drug in the body to its plasma concentration (Vd = amount of drug in body /
            plasma concentration). It's expressed in liters (l) or l/kg and is not a real volume.
            <br><br> <b>Practical importance of Vd</b>: A high Vd (e.g., 20-40 l/kg for some tricyclic antidepressants,
            antipsychotics, up to 200 l/kg for chloroquine) indicates significant tissue binding, meaning a large
            portion of
            the dose resides in tissues, and plasma concentration is relatively low. Vd is crucial for determining the
            necessary <b>loading dose</b> to achieve a desired plasma concentration. For drugs with a large Vd or slow
            distribution, a loading dose must be given very slowly or in multiple doses to avoid temporarily high plasma
            concentrations and intoxication, especially if the drug has a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., digoxin,
            amiodarone). Vd is also important for intoxications: if a drug has a large Vd, forced elimination methods
            like
            hemodialysis are generally ineffective.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Eliminatie: metabolisme en excretie (Elimination: metabolism and excretion)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Elimination of drugs primarily occurs via the <b>liver and kidneys</b>.
            <br><br> <b>Metabolisme (Metabolism)</b>: In the liver, elimination often occurs through <b>chemical changes
                to
                the drug molecules (biotransformation or metabolization)</b>. <b>Prodrugs</b> are an exception; they are
            inactive substances that become active after metabolic conversion. Metabolism can also occur in other organs
            like kidneys, intestines, lungs, and placenta, indicating the role of metabolizing enzymes in detoxification
            and
            protecting the fetus.
            <br> <b>First-pass effect</b>: If an orally ingested drug is partly metabolized in the intestinal wall
            (presystemic metabolism) and/or in the liver before reaching systemic circulation, this is called the
            first-pass
            effect. It can significantly reduce and make bioavailability uncertain. Presystemic metabolism is the main
            cause
            of reduced bioavailability. Rectal administration can sometimes prevent presystemic metabolism as there are
            no
            metabolic enzymes in the rectal wall, and blood from the middle and lower rectal veins bypasses the liver
            initially.
            <br> Metabolism reactions are categorized into <b>Type 1 reactions</b> (hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction)
            and
            <b>Type 2 or conjugation reactions</b> (acetylation, glucuronidation, sulfation). Type 1 products can be
            inactive or have a different efficacy/side effect profile. Type 2 products are usually pharmacologically
            inactive, though exceptions exist (e.g., active glucuronides of morphine and midazolam).
            <br> The <b>cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system</b> is crucial for drug metabolism (oxidative Type 1 reactions),
            particularly CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 families. Important individual enzymes include CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
            CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Many drugs are substrates for specific enzymes, meaning they can be metabolized by them
            or
            induce/inhibit them.
            <br> CYP enzymes show <b>high interindividual variability</b> in catalytic capacity due to genetic variation
            and
            environmental factors (enzyme induction/inhibition by food, smoking, co-medication). Genetic polymorphism is
            especially relevant for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, -2C9, or -2C19. Clinical signs of relevant genetic
            polymorphism include unexpectedly low/absent effect or unexpectedly severe side effects.
            <br><br> <b>Excretie (Excretion)</b>: A substance and/or its metabolite(s) may leave the body mainly via a
            transporter through <b>bile/feces (excretion)</b>. In some cases, the substance may be reabsorbed from the
            GI
            tract after conjugate cleavage (enterohepatic circulation), leading to a longer stay in the body and a
            prolonged
            duration of action.
            <br> The <b>kidneys</b> excrete water-soluble substances through <b>glomerular filtration</b> and/or
            <b>active
                tubular secretion</b> via transporters. Hydrophilic substances that are not sufficiently water-soluble
            are
            typically converted in the liver into more hydrophilic forms (Type 1 and 2 reactions) before renal
            excretion.
            <br> Another elimination mechanism involves <b>energy-dependent efflux pumps/transporters</b>, such as
            <b>P-glycoprotein (Pgp)</b>. Pgp in the GI tract contributes to reduced bioavailability by excreting
            absorbed
            drugs back into the lumen. It also aids in active renal excretion (e.g., digoxin) and is present in the
            blood-brain barrier and placenta.
            <br> <b>Clearance (CL)</b> is a measure of the body's elimination capacity by the liver and kidneys (and
            other
            pathways) for a drug. It is defined as the volume of plasma completely cleared of the drug per unit time
            (l/hr
            or l/hr/kg).
        </p>

        <h2><b>Verblijfsduur en plateaufase (Duration of stay and plateau phase)</b></h2>
        <p>
            The <b>half-life</b> is used as a measure of the duration a drug stays in the body. This can be the
            <b>plasma
                half-life (T½)</b> or the <b>elimination half-life (T½el or T½β)</b>. Plasma half-life is the time for
            plasma concentration to halve. Elimination half-life specifically refers to this value in the elimination
            phase
            (when absorption has ceased), providing more information about the elimination rate.
            <br><br> Half-life is directly proportional to the volume of distribution and inversely proportional to
            clearance.
            <br><br> Elimination generally follows <b>first-order kinetics</b>, meaning a fixed percentage of the drug
            is
            cleared per unit time. If the elimination system is not saturated, 94% of an administered dose is excreted
            after
            four T½el, and 97% after five T½el. This knowledge is important for medication changes, interactions, and
            managing side effects or intoxications.
            <br><br> T½el is generally substance-specific and independent of the dosage form. However, with controlled
            or
            sustained-release dosage forms, new drug constantly enters circulation, making the T½el appear prolonged
            (apparent elimination half-life).
            <br><br> When a drug is administered repeatedly, and the daily absorbed fraction equals the daily eliminated
            amount, the plasma concentration fluctuates around a nearly constant value, known as the <b>steady state or
                plateau phase</b>. This plateau is reached after approximately four to five times the T½el. The clinical
            effect of the drug should generally be assessed during this plateau phase. The average plasma concentration
            during the plateau phase is proportional to the daily dose and bioavailability, and inversely proportional
            to
            the dosing interval and clearance.
            <br><br> If drug elimination depends on enzymes or transporters, plasma concentration can rise
            disproportionately with small dose increases if the elimination system becomes saturated (e.g., phenytoin).
        </p>

        <h2><b>Plasmaconcentratie en werking (Plasma concentration and effect)</b></h2>
        <p>
            For a drug to work, a certain amount of active substance must reach the relevant receptors. Since this is
            not
            directly measurable, plasma concentration is often used as a proxy. However, plasma concentration does not
            always directly correlate with the clinical effect (efficacy and side effects). This one-to-one relationship
            doesn't hold when active metabolites are formed (each with their own clearance, Vd, and half-life) or for
            irreversible receptor/enzyme blockers (where action persists after drug elimination until new
            receptors/enzymes
            are produced).
            <br><br> For most active substances, there is a reasonable to good correlation between dose/plasma
            concentration
            and clinical effect.
            <br><br> <b>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)</b> (monitoring plasma concentration) can be especially useful
            for
            drugs with a <b>narrow therapeutic window</b>, unexpected changes in clinical effect in unstable patients
            (ICU
            patients), in cases of interactions, and for checking therapy adherence. For chronic drugs requiring a
            constant
            plasma concentration, TDM helps determine a reference plasma concentration for the patient. Examples include
            phenytoin and lithium. TDM is also used for adherence monitoring for anti-epileptics, antidepressants,
            antipsychotics, and some immunosuppressants.

        <h1>
            <b>Het gedrag van monoklonale antilichamen in het lichaam (The behavior of monoclonal antibodies in the
                body)</b>
        </h1>
        <p>
            Intact monoclonal antibodies are among the largest molecules used as drugs. Their <b>molecular size and
                structure lead to an abnormal pharmacokinetics</b> compared to smaller molecules. Most registered
            monoclonal
            antibodies belong to the IgG family and are used for autoimmune diseases, oncology, and asthma.
            <br><br> <b>Absorptie</b>: Monoclonal antibodies are <b>not absorbed from the GI tract</b> because they are
            proteins broken down in the gut, and their large size and hydrophilic nature limit intestinal wall
            permeability.
            Thus, most are administered <b>intravenously</b>, some subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Local
            administration
            is rarely possible (e.g., intra-ocular for macular degeneration, pulmonary for asthma).
            <br> Absorption after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration is much slower than for smaller
            molecules.
            They struggle to cross the endothelial barrier and are transported via the lymph, eventually reaching the
            blood/circulation via lymph nodes. The time to maximal blood levels (one to eight days) depends on injection
            site, lymph composition, and physical movement.
            <br><br> <b>Biologische beschikbaarheid (Bioavailability)</b>: After subcutaneous or intramuscular
            administration, bioavailability (relative to IV) is often <b>lower (approx. 50-75%)</b> than for smaller
            molecules, due to proteolysis (breakdown) in the lymph.
            <br><br> <b>Verdelingsvolume (Volume of distribution)</b>: Monoclonal antibodies have a <b>small Vd</b>.
            Their
            large size and hydrophilic nature prevent diffusion from the bloodstream, so their Vd often approximates the
            <b>plasma volume</b>. Some extravasation can occur via convection and pinocytosis in endothelial cells. In
            tumor
            tissue, they mostly accumulate in or near blood vessels. Tumor penetration depends on interstitial pressure
            and
            antibody structure. Modifying antibodies (e.g., using only Fab-fragments) can improve tissue distribution.
            <br><br> <b>Metabolisme (Metabolism)</b>: Due to their size, monoclonal antibodies are <b>not (or hardly)
                excreted in urine</b>. They are broken down into peptides and amino acids, likely through
            <b>proteolysis</b>
            in tissues, especially intracellularly in endothelial and target cells. Phagocytes (macrophages, natural
            killer
            cells) also break them down after Fc-part binding.
            <br><br> <b>(Eliminatie)halfwaardetijd ((Elimination) half-life)</b>: Intact monoclonal antibodies typically
            have a <b>long half-life</b>. This is because they are naturally protected from elimination by <b>neonatal
                Fc-receptors (FcRn)</b>. Endogenous IgG has a half-life of about 23 days. FcRn protects circulating
            immunoglobulins from degradation by binding to their non-specific Fc-portion intracellularly, then returning
            them to circulation. Unbound immunoglobulin is degraded intracellularly. At high doses, elimination becomes
            non-linear due to saturation of these protective receptors, leading to increased clearance.
            <br><br> <b>Nieuwe ontwikkelingen (New developments)</b>: Modifications to the immunoglobulin molecule aim
            to
            improve tissue distribution and/or therapeutic activity. <b>Fab-fragments</b> (antibodies without an
            Fc-part)
            are already used; their smaller size allows better tissue distribution but results in a significantly
            shorter
            half-life (e.g., 30 minutes). Fab-fragments can also be renally cleared as relatively small molecules.
            Experiments are ongoing to modify the Fc-part to improve pharmacokinetics.

            <b>Kinetische parameters bij zwangerschap, functiestoornissen en ziekten (Kinetic parameters during
                pregnancy, organ dysfunctions, and diseases)</b>
        </h1>
        <h2><b>Inleiding (Introduction)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Pharmacokinetic parameters published in official product information and textbooks are <b>average values</b>
            obtained from relatively healthy individuals. Increasingly, these values are also determined in target
            patient
            groups and populations known to have altered kinetic parameters, such as infants, young children, the
            elderly,
            pregnant women, and people with kidney or liver diseases. Changes in drug distribution and elimination rates
            are
            particularly important.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Zwangerschap (Pregnancy)</b></h2>
        <p>
            During pregnancy, physiological changes can affect drug use, especially for drugs with a <b>narrow
                therapeutic
                window</b>. Changes include:
            <br><br> Increased stomach pH (affecting absorption and bioavailability).
            <br><br> Increased plasma volume (up to approx. 42%) and total body water (up to approx. 21%; important for
            hydrophilic drugs).
            <br><br> Increased glomerular filtration rate (approx. 50%).
            <br><br> Unpredictable changes in tubular processes (important for elimination).
            <br><br> Induction of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes, and inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 enzymes (important for
            elimination or active substance formation).
        </p>

        <h2><b>Nierfunctiestoornissen (Renal dysfunctions)</b></h2>
        <p>
            For most drugs and active metabolites removed by the kidneys, elimination occurs through <b>glomerular
                filtration</b>. Significant reduction in glomerular filtration due to kidney disease increases the risk
            of
            <b>drug accumulation</b>. If renal function is stable, dose reduction can be calculated based on
            <b>creatinine
                clearance</b> and the fraction normally renally eliminated. Total clearance (renal + extrarenal) is used
            for
            adjustment.
            <br><br> Various formulas estimate kidney function. Older drugs often use creatinine clearance (Clcr)
            estimated
            by the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Newer drugs often use body surface area-normalized estimated glomerular
            filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by CKD-EPI or MDRD formulas.
            <br><br> The KNMP (Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association) working group recommends using Clcr for dosing
            advice in
            the G-Standard because studies supporting the advice often rely on Clcr. Adjusting Clcr to eGFR for dosing
            advice is unlikely to improve patient outcomes.
            <br><br> Drug distribution typically does not change with impaired renal function, unless edema (e.g.,
            nephrotic
            syndrome) or end-stage renal failure is present.
            <br><br> Special attention is needed for immature kidneys in neonates and the slow decline in renal function
            with aging.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Leverfunctiestoornissen (Liver dysfunctions)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Predicting a potential decrease in elimination with liver disease is often difficult. Factors include:
            <br><br> Decreased activity of some CYP450 enzyme families.
            <br><br> Changes in functional liver tissue.
            <br><br> Changes in liver blood flow (e.g., histological changes in capillary walls, presence of shunts,
            reduced
            blood flow).
            <br><br> Oxygen deficiency (affecting oxygen-dependent Phase-1 oxidation reactions).
            <br><br> The liver has significant regenerative capacity and reserve, so impaired function may only become
            noticeable in advanced stages of liver disease.
            <br><br> Due to the diverse nature of liver abnormalities and the lack of clear parameters to measure them
            (unlike renal dysfunction), predicting the extent and manner of changes in drug elimination is difficult.
            <br><br> A critical aspect is <b>impaired renal function</b> that can occur with liver diseases. If the
            unchanged drug or an active metabolite is significantly eliminated via the kidneys, dose reduction might be
            necessary. Serum creatinine may not accurately reflect renal function in liver failure patients due to
            decreased
            muscle mass and reduced conversion of creatine to creatinine. In practice, renal function is often
            overestimated
            in patients with liver cirrhosis based on creatinine clearance.
            <br><br> Reduced hepatic elimination capacity in young children also requires attention.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Hartfalen (Heart failure)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Changes in organ circulation can alter absorption, distribution, and elimination.
            <br><br> <b>Edema</b> increases the volume of distribution, thereby lowering the plasma concentration of
            hydrophilic drugs.
            <br><br> Edema around the intestines is considered a factor influencing absorption.
            <br><br> Local hypoxia can damage tissues, such as parts of the liver, affecting CYP450 system function.
            <br><br> These factors can lead to an unexpected drug effect. Special attention is needed for drugs with a
            relatively <b>low bioavailability (F < 20%)</b>, as small changes can have significant consequences.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Anorexia nervosa, cachexie en obesitas (Anorexia nervosa, cachexia, and obesity)</b></h2>
        <p>
            In diseases with rapid body weight loss (e.g., anorexia nervosa, HIV wasting, malignancy cachexia),
            significant metabolic changes occur, altering drug response.
            <br><br> Kinetic parameters are usually changed: <b>body composition and thus Vd</b>, <b>plasma protein
                binding</b> (due to protein deficiency), and <b>reduced liver function and clearance</b>. Research
            on drug pharmacokinetics and necessary dose adjustments in these groups is limited.
            <br><br> In (morbid) obesity and after bariatric surgery, important pharmacokinetic changes also occur.
            <br> <b>Obesity</b>: Factors include increased fat mass, increased cardiac output, and altered liver and
            kidney blood flow, influencing distribution, metabolism, and clearance. Dose adjustments for some drugs
            depend on drug properties (lipophilicity, protein binding, extraction ratio, clearance route) and
            patient characteristics (degree of overweight, liver/kidney dysfunction).
            <br> <b>Bariatric surgery</b>: Changes in GI anatomy and physiology (smaller stomach volume, higher
            stomach pH, reduced exposure to digestive enzymes, reduced absorption surface) can affect drug
            absorption. Weight loss can also change Vd, depending on drug properties. These changes can alter
            systemic drug exposure.
            <br><br> Extra vigilance is advised for drug effects and side effects in these patient groups.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Intensive care-patiënten (Intensive care patients)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Drug effects are often unpredictable in ICU patients due to infrequent steady-state conditions. Major
            influences on pharmacokinetics include:
            <br><br> Changes in <b>circulation, liver function, kidney function, fluid and electrolyte balance</b>.
            <br><br> Changes in <b>Vd</b> (due to muscle loss, edema, fluid administration/removal, extracorporeal
            circulation like dialysis or ECMO).
            <br><br> <b>Parenteral administration</b> is often necessary due to significant disruption of enteral
            physiology, and some medications cannot be given via feeding tubes.
            <br><br> For many commonly used ICU drugs, alternative dosing regimens and other important
            considerations (e.g., PK changes in Vd) have been mapped out. Due to uncertainty of drug effects,
            <b>intensive blood level monitoring (TDM)</b> is frequently used.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Afwijkende maag-darmmotiliteit (Abnormal gastrointestinal motility)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Changes in GI motility can alter the speed and/or extent of absorption, depending on where the drug is
            normally absorbed and the type of motility disorder. Motility can be altered by disease or co-medication
            (e.g., anticholinergics, opiates, domperidone, metoclopramide). These changes are generally rarely
            relevant. A significant exception is <b>intoxication with anticholinergic agents</b>, where stomach
            motility and absorption can be severely delayed, leading to a maximal effect manifesting only after
            days. In other intoxications, Tmax is often difficult to predict.
        </p>

        <h1>
            <b>Interacties tijdens de verschillende kinetische processen (Interactions during the various
                kinetic processes)</b>
        </h1>
        <h2><b>Inleiding (Introduction)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Drug interactions can occur during various kinetic processes, leading to a <b>decrease or increase in
                the amount of drug at the receptors</b>. The clinical relevance of these changes (in efficacy and/or
            side effects) depends on the <b>therapeutic window</b> of the drug and the patient's homeostatic
            mechanisms to compensate for effect changes (e.g., blood pressure, body temperature regulation).
        </p>
        <h2><b>Absorptie (Absorption)</b></h2>
        <p>
            <br><br> <b>Chemical reactions in the GI tract</b>: Interactions can occur when drugs become unsuitable
            for absorption due to chemical reactions. Examples include calcium ions (from antacids, milk, tube
            feeding) with tetracycline, (tube) feeding with levothyroxine, bisphosphonates, fluoroquinolones; iron
            ions with doxycycline; colestyramine with vitamin K antagonists and digoxin. This mechanism is utilized
            in intoxications by administering activated charcoal orally.
            <br><br> <b>Presystemic metabolism</b>: Interference with absorption also happens via presystemic
            metabolism in the GI tract, primarily involving <b>CYP3A4</b>. Inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by one
            drug can enhance the absorption and increase the bioavailability of another drug significantly affected
            by the first-pass effect (presystemic clearance). Grapefruit juice, for example, is thought to
            irreversibly inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 for about 74 hours. Another example is Cushing's syndrome when
            budesonide is combined with some macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin) or triazoles
            (itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), which inhibit its presystemic and systemic metabolism,
            leading to high budesonide concentrations.
            <br><br> <b>pH influence</b>: Altering stomach pH is another mechanism. For instance, "enteric coated"
            tablets should not be taken simultaneously with antacids, as increased stomach pH causes premature
            dissolution.
            <br><br> <b>Altered GI motility</b>: Changes in GI motility can be clinically relevant, especially with
            severe diarrhea, ileus, or due to drug interactions, and can significantly delay absorption in
            intoxications.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Eiwitbinding (Protein binding)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Interactions due to plasma protein binding interference are rarely clinically relevant. If one drug
            displaces another from protein binding, the concentration of unbound (and thus active) drug in plasma
            initially rises. However, this increase is quickly offset by rapid distribution to interstitial
            spaces/tissues and increased elimination.
            <br><br> A clinically relevant temporary increase in unbound concentration is only expected if drug A
            has:
            <br> <b>High plasma protein binding (≥ 90%)</b>.
            <br> A <b>small volume of distribution</b>.
            <br> A <b>narrow therapeutic window</b>.
            <br> Is eliminated by a <b>saturable enzyme or transporter system</b>.
            <br><br> In known interactions (e.g., tolbutamide/sulfonamides, vitamin K antagonists/salicylates),
            other mechanisms (like elimination influence) play a more significant role than protein displacement.
            Protein binding is mentioned in drug texts if ≥ 90%.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Eliminatie (Elimination)</b></h2>
        <p>
            Interactions in the elimination phase can result from <b>competition for available enzymes</b> (e.g.,
            plasma esterases, P450 enzymes) and <b>transporters</b> (e.g., in tubular secretion, biliary excretion).
            Other factors like renal blood flow and urine pH can also influence the eliminated amount per unit time
            (e.g., NSAIDs with lithium or metformin, sodium bicarbonate with quinidine or methotrexate).
            <br><br> <b>CYP450 system interactions</b>: The clinical relevance can be more precisely predicted due
            to the classification into subfamilies and isoenzymes. The risk of interaction increases if the
            substrate (the drug whose metabolism is affected) has only one important metabolic pathway, and the
            relevant enzyme is strongly inhibited or induced by another drug.
            <br> <b>Table 2</b> provides examples of strong inhibitors and inducers for various CYP450 subfamilies
            that cause important clinical interactions.
            <br> - <b>CYP1A2</b>: Strong inhibitors include ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine. Strong inducers include
            carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, tobacco.
            <br> - <b>CYP2C19</b>: Strong inhibitors include fluvoxamine. Strong inducers include apalutamide,
            enzalutamide, rifampicin.
            <br> - <b>CYP2C8</b>: Strong inhibitors include gemfibrozil, clopidogrel. Strong inducers include
            rifampicin.
            <br> - <b>CYP2C9</b>: Strong inhibitors include benzbromarone, phenylbutazone, fluconazole, miconazole,
            voriconazole. Strong inducers include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin.
            <br> - <b>CYP2D6</b>: Strong inhibitors include bupropion, cinacalcet, (nor)fluoxetine, paroxetine,
            quinine, quinidine, propafenone, ritonavir, terbinafine. This subgroup is generally relatively
            insensitive to inducing substances.
            <br> - <b>CYP2E1</b>: Strong inhibitors include disulfiram. Strong inducers include isoniazid, ethanol.
            <br> - <b>CYP3A4</b>: Strong inhibitors include macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin), imidazole
            derivatives (itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), HIV protease inhibitors
            (ritonavir, saquinavir), ribociclib, grapefruit (juice). Strong inducers include apalutamide,
            enzalutamide, ceritinib, dabrafenib, idelalisib, lorlatinib, mitotane, carbamazepine, rifampicin, St.
            John's wort.
            <br> <b>Consequences of interactions</b>: Interactions can have major consequences if the substrate has
            a <b>small bioavailability (F < 20%)</b>, a <b>narrow therapeutic window</b>, or if the
                    substrate/metabolite has <b>toxic properties</b>. For example, the high risk of 'torsades de
                    pointes' with interactions between (moderately to strong) enzyme inhibitors and QT-interval
                    prolonging drugs.
                    <br> <b>Onset and offset</b>: <b>Inhibition of CYP enzymes</b> occurs quickly and is usually
                    reversible; its disappearance depends on the inhibitor's half-life. <b>Induction of CYP
                        enzymes</b> (extra enzyme production) is more gradual (days to weeks). The disappearance of
                    induction is also gradual (usually several weeks), depending on the inducer's half-life and the
                    breakdown of the extra enzymes produced.
                    <br><br> Drug texts generally list more potential interactions than drug monitoring systems
                    because the ultimate clinical relevance is not always predictable, as it is a sum of effects on
                    both enzyme systems and transporters.

            initiating or blocking a reaction.
            <br><br> <b>Therapeutische breedte</b>: Difference in drug amount for therapeutic vs. toxic
            effect; narrow range means toxic effects occur quickly with accumulation/small overdose.
