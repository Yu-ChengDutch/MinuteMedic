        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>These birth defects arise when the process of <b>neurulation</b> during the <b>third week of pregnancy</b> does not occur completely. This then leaves part of the newly formed <b>neural tube</b> open, which causes trouble. There are various type, depending on what part of the tube doesn't close:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Spina bifida: Affects the spine</li>
            <li>Anencephaly: Affects the telencephalon</li>
            <li>Encephalocele: Affects the skull</li>
            <li>Iniencephaly: Effects the neck and occipital lobe</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Statistically, NTDs are relatively common: possibly the most common birth defect. Yearly, roughly <b>300.000 children</b> are born with a NTD, which results in roughly <b>71.000 deaths</b> globally. However, from this number stillborn and aborted children are quite often excluded. More than half of cases are aborted, which not only is a grave tragedy, but also makes it hard to study the actual numbers.</p>
        <p>Prevention is done through ensuring sufficient levels of <b>folic acid</b> prior to and during pregancy, which is ensured through enrichment of dietary sources as well as supplementation. In Canada, mandatory fortification has already lead to a <b>45% decrease</b> in cases. It is insufficient, however, to rely even on a fortified diet: supplementation is necessary to achieve the recommended <b>400 mcg or 4 mg daily</b>. Risk factors then include <b>maternal obesity</b> and <b>maternal smoking and second hand smoke</b> as well as <b>low vitamin B12</b> or <b>high homocysteine</b>. A known danger is UV exposure, as that causes UV radiation-induced folate photolysis. Protection from the sun then, is imperative. Luckily, the body already naturally adapts by increasing the concentration of melanin inside the skin during pregnancy.</p>

        <p>While folate deficiency is strongly correlated with NTDs, it does not, by itself and directly, cause NTDs. For that, a gene-environment interaction is necessary: folate prevents otherwise sub-clinical mutations from causing clinical conditions.</p>

        <h1>Spina bifida</h1>

        <p>In essence, <b>spina bifida</b> refers to an <b>incomplete closing of the spine and meninges</b> which arises during early development in preganancy. There are three subtypes of SB (see image):</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Spina bifida occulta</li>
            <li>Meningocele</li>
            <li>Myelomeningocele</li>
            <li>Myelocele</li>

        </ol>

        <p>The latter two might be grouped together as <b>spina bifida cystica</b>.</p>

        <img src="Images/image_spina_bifida.jpg">

        <p>SB is most commonly located in the <b>lower back</b> but may also occur in the middle back or neck. If it occurs </p>
        
        <h2>Spina bifida occulta</h2>
        <p>Here, the <b>posterior part</b> of some of the vertebrae is not completely closed. However, as the splits as small, the <b>spinal cord does not protrude</b>. The skin over the laesion is either normal, or hairy, dimpled or birthmarked. Unlike in other types of NTDs, <b>alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)</b>, a common biomarker, is not elevated because indeed, the dural lining is intact.</p>

        <h2>Meningocele</h2>
        <p>This form is <b>rare</b> and also <b>rarely clinically significant</b>. While problems with a tethered cord may occur, it usually doesn't cause trouble as the CNS remains undamaged. While the spain is the most common, it may also occur in <b>occipital, frontoethmoidal or nasal</b> locations of the skull. The endonasal type may be mistaken for a <b>nasal polyp</b> but contains brain tissue.</p>

        <h2>Myelomeningocele</h2>
        <p>This is the type of spinal bifida that often results in <b>the most severe complications</b> as it affects the meninges and nerves. Here, the spinal cord protrudes through an opening, as the rostral pore does not close fully. Here then, a sack forms, protected by the meninges. </p>

        <h2>Myelocele</h2>
        <p>The <b>most severe form</b> is one in which the spinal cord is fully exposed without overlying membrane. The nerves then, are often damaged or not properly developed which results in some level of paralysis and loss of sensation.</p>

        <h1>Complications</h1>
        <p>Depending on the type and height of laesion, several complications may occur: <b>leg weakness, paralysis, orthopaedic abnormalities (e.g., club foot, hip dislocation, scoliosis), bladder and bowel control issues, pressure sores, skin problems, abnormal eye movements, eventually developing an allergy to latex (68%)</b>. Quite often, SB is associated with <b>Arnold-Chiari malformation</b>. In case of myelomeningocele, <b>90% of people</b> develop hydrocephalus as the displaced cerebellum interferes with normal flow of CSF. Often, with associated cerebellar abnormalities. In these patients, <b>70-90%</b> also have an abnormal <b>corpus callosum</b>. Any youth with SB, but especially those with <b>shunted hydrocephalus</b> experience challenges with <b>executive function</b>, which then does not increase with age, presenting with <b>ADHD</b> in roughly one third of cases. Similarly, roughly <b>60%</b> are diagnosed with a learning disability. While reading ability is often good, comprehension of abstract concepts is not.</p>

        <h1>Anencephaly</h1>
        <p>This NTD entails the ebsence of a major portion of the <b>brain, skull and scalp</b> following a failure to close the rostral end of the neural tube. Contrary to the name, it is the <b>telencephalon</b> alone that is missing. The structure that remains is covered by a thin layer of membrane, and all proper structures (skin, bone, meninges) are lacking. Usually, infants survive mere <b>hours or days after birth</b>.</p>
        <p>The child born with anencephaly is "usually blind, deaf, unaware of its surroundings, and unable to feel pain". While some anencephalics are born with a brainstem, the fact they do not posess a cerebrum rules out the possibility of ever being aware of their surroundings.</p>
        <p>There is evidence for a <b>autosomal recessive</b> form of inheritance. In practice, this means that, having had a single child with anencephaly, the mother has a 3% chance for another.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis is done prenatally through an ultrasound, as well as AFP-screening in the maternal serum. </p>

        <h1>Iniencephaly</h1>
        <p>A rare disorder, <b>iniencephaly</b> is characterised by three characteristics:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Defect to the occipital bone</li>
            <li>Spina Bifida of the cervical vertebrae</li>
            <li>Retroflexion of the head on the cervical spine</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Practically, all patients are stillborn. Usually, the infant is of short stature, with a disproportionally large head. The neck is hyperextended, with an enlarged foramen magnum. The skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face. Hence, there <b>is no neck</b>, because of which the head position is referred to as <b>star-gazing</b>.</p>
        <p>While the cause remains unknown, there are various genetic and pharmacological factors that might well be associated with the pathogenesis.</p>

        <h1>Encephalocele</h1>
        <p>Often associated with <b>other craniofacial abnormalities</b>, the encephalocele is characterised by sac-like protrusions of brain and meninges through openings in the skull. Symptoms may include <b>neurologic problems, hydrocephalus, spastic quadriplaegia, microcephalia, ataxia, developmental delay, mental and gowth retardation, and seizures</b>.</p>
        <p>Ideally, it's cured during infancy, by repositioning the bulge back into the skull and then closing the opening. This releases pressure, and allows the brain to develop normally. Occasionally, shunts are left behind to drain excess CSF from the brain.</p>
