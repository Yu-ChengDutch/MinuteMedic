        <h1>Introduction and Epidemiology</h1>
        <p><b>Muscle contractures</b> are characterized by unique muscle changes that <b>increase the passive stiffness
                of the muscle</b> and <b>limit the mobility of the joints without any active force production</b>. They
            are a common complication in neurological disorders such as stroke, cerebral palsy (CP), spinal cord injury,
            and multiple sclerosis. The reported prevalence ranges from <b>36% to 60%</b> depending on the specific
            disorder. These contractures lead to <b>joints becoming fixated in awkward or abnormal positions</b>, which
            obstructs normal physical activity and can result in considerable pain, strength loss, and muscle atrophy.
        </p>

        <h1>Aetiology and Pathophysiology</h1>
        <p>
            Muscle contractures can arise from various factors, fundamentally involving the shortening of the muscle and
            its tendons, leading to reduced flexibility. While it was generally assumed that contractures are related to
            abnormally high muscle activity (spasticity), recent findings indicate that spasticity alone might not be
            the deciding cause, as contractures can develop without prior evidence of spasticity and anti-spastic
            medication often has no effect. Instead, contractures are increasingly viewed as an <b>adaptation in tissue
                homeostasis within the neuromuscular–tendon–connective tissue complex</b>, influenced by interactions
            between neural, mechanical, metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic factors.
            <br><br>
            Key causes and contributing mechanisms include:
            <br> - <b>Immobilization:</b> Prolonged immobilization, especially in a shortened position, can lead to
            fibrous adhesion formation, loss of sarcomeres, and reduced tissue extensibility. For example, casting a
            limb after a fracture can shorten muscles due to disuse. Chronic toe walking, whether voluntary (due to
            sensory issues in autism) or involuntary (due to spasticity in cerebral palsy), can lead to calf muscle
            contractures if the muscles are not adequately stretched.
            <br> - <b>Spasticity:</b> If left untreated, the hypertonia (loss of muscle tone inhibition) causes constant
            muscle contraction, fixing the joint in a flexed state. However, distinguishing the role of continuous
            involuntary muscle activity (spastic dystonia) from hyperactive stretch reflexes (spasticity in its original
            definition) is crucial, as spastic dystonia, caused by central mechanisms, may contribute more to
            contractures.
            <br> - <b>Muscle Imbalance:</b> An imbalance between agonist and antagonist muscles can result from
            neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries, myopathy, or postural habits. This can lead to continuous
            disuse and atrophy of some muscles while others remain in constant contraction, exacerbating contractures.
            <br> - <b>Low ATP Reservoir:</b> In metabolic myopathies like McArdle disease (GSD-V) and Tarui disease
            (GSD-VII), temporary muscle contractures develop due to ATP (energy) deficiency, causing muscles to contract
            and fail to relax. These differ from cramps as they are intrinsic to the muscle and not nerve-elicited.
            <br> - <b>Congenital Muscular Dystrophies:</b> Conditions such as Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital
            muscular dystrophy, caused by mutations in collagen VI and XII genes, can lead to muscle contractures due to
            deficient collagen in the extracellular matrix, resulting in dystrophic changes and fibrosis.
            <br> - <b>Congenital Myopathies:</b> Core, nemaline, and centronuclear myopathies can also cause
            contractures in the extremities and spine.
            <br> - <b>Ischemia:</b> Restriction of blood flow following trauma (e.g., fractures, crush injuries, burns)
            can lead to muscle tissue death (necrosis) and subsequent contracture, such as Volkmann's contracture.
            <br> - <b>Adhesions and Fibrosis:</b> Muscle injury (e.g., burns, surgery, repetitive or micro-injuries) can
            cause internal scar tissue (myofibrosis) to develop, binding muscle fibers, limiting contractibility, and
            stiffening muscles, leading to restricted movement, pain, and weakness.
            <br> - <b>Mismatch between Muscle and Bone Length:</b> Impaired muscle growth and atrophy, especially in
            children with CP, can lead to muscles being too short relative to bone length. This may be due to reduced
            neural activation and disuse, potentially triggering contractures through stretching and stress on
            sarcomeres. Bone growth itself can be affected, showing delayed maturation, diminished linear growth, and
            low bone density in CP and stroke patients.
            <br> - <b>Muscle Micro-architecture:</b> The number of sarcomeres in a muscle can adapt to joint position;
            immobilization in a shortened position decreases sarcomere number. In spastic CP and spinal cord injury
            patients, sarcomeres may be stretched and longer, and titin isoforms might be critical to these structural
            changes and calcium binding.
            <br> - <b>Tensional Homeostasis:</b> Cells maintain tension within their surroundings. A disruption of this
            homeostasis, potentially due to altered forces, perturbed response to mechanical stimuli, or stiffening of
            the extracellular matrix, could be involved in muscle contracture development.
            <br> - <b>Calcium Signalling Impairment:</b> Intracellular calcium concentration dysregulation, observed in
            CP and muscular dystrophy, can lead to cellular damage and affect muscle development, repair, and
            regeneration.
            <br> - <b>Impaired Micro-vascularization:</b> Reduced blood flow to skeletal muscle, potentially due to
            vascular degeneration or increased shear stress, affects tissue maintenance, repair, and remodeling.
            Patients with CP and stroke show reduced capillary density in affected muscles.
            <br> - <b>Genetics and Epigenetics:</b> While contractures are generally not considered purely genetic, some
            genetic mutations (e.g., in collagen VI for Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy) directly cause them.
            Epigenetic mechanisms (like DNA methylation, histone acetylation/methylation, and microRNAs) are
            increasingly recognized for their influence on muscle development, regeneration, and disease, potentially
            affecting the severity and even initiation of contractures.

        <h1>Assessment, Diagnosis and Prognosis</h1>
        <p>The effectiveness of contracture treatment is often evaluated by measuring <b>passive joint range of motion
                (ROM)</b>, but assessing the effects on structural and mechanical properties of muscle by evaluating the
            <b>torque-angle relationship</b> can provide deeper understanding. Systematic reviews indicate a significant
            challenge in assessing outcomes, as <b>many trials rely on non-objective goniometric measurements</b> (e.g.,
            standard goniometers without torque control) and often lack assessor blinding, introducing a <b>large
                possibility of bias</b>. Only 18 out of 70 trials in one review used objective measures like <b>passive
                stiffness or torque-controlled goniometric measurements</b>. For treatment efficacy, a <b>minimal
                clinically important effect is often set at 5°</b> of passive range of motion (PROM).</p>

        <h1>Treatment (Surgical and Nonsurgical)</h1>
        <p>Overall, current literature suggests that <b>effective nonsurgical treatment for muscle contractures is yet
                to be convincingly established</b>, highlighting a need for more controlled trials with objective
            measures and sufficient participant numbers.</p>

        <h2>Surgical Treatment</h2>
        <p>Surgical procedures such as <b>various forms of tendon lengthening and intramuscular aponeurotic
                recession</b> are used to restore joint mobility. While these procedures may temporarily increase the
            range of motion, they <b>rarely have lasting effects</b>. Surgery can also lead to complications, including
            <b>reduced force production and ROM</b> due to shifts in sarcomere locations, and the <b>shortening of
                surgically lengthened muscle can re-occur</b>. <b>Botulinum toxins A and B</b> can be used as an adjunct
            to surgery for refractory muscle contracture, but their effectiveness diminishes over time, and most
            patients require a single treatment within the first few weeks post-surgery.</p>

        <h2>Nonsurgical Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Stretching:</b>
            <br> - Stretching is a common intervention. However, recent meta-analyses indicate that stretching <b>does
                not significantly increase passive joint amplitudes</b> in patients with stroke.
            <br> - It is considered <b>more beneficial as a preventative measure and for maintaining existing range of
                motion</b> rather than as a primary treatment.
            <br> - A Cochrane review found that stretching <b>does not provide short-term pain relief</b>.
            <br> - One systematic review found a small pooled effect of <b>3° PROM</b> for stretch interventions, which
            is considered <b>clinically non-important</b> (less than the 5° threshold).
            <br> - <b>Longer interventions with high stretching volumes and/or loads (e.g., 52 weeks)</b> may have
            effects on muscle/joint mechanical properties for preventing or treating contractures after stroke, with one
            such intervention increasing muscle fascicle length and thickness.
            <br> - <b>Stretching should be avoided</b> for muscle contractures resulting from a low ATP reservoir (e.g.,
            in metabolic myopathies) as it may cause further muscle damage by tearing muscle fibers.

            <br><br><b>Orthoses:</b>
            <br> - Lower limb orthoses, particularly <b>Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs) and Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthoses
                (KAFOs)</b>, are frequently prescribed as an integral part of rehabilitation for children with cerebral
            palsy (CP).
            <br> - Their aims include <b>prevention and correction of deformities, maintenance of correct muscle
                lengths, improvement of postural control, support for impaired body segments, inhibition or increase of
                movement, support for weak muscles, improvement of selective motor control, reduction of spasticity, and
                protection in the post-operative period</b>.
            <br> - <b>AFOs</b> are designed to improve walking quality and energy expenditure, enhance foot and ankle
            functionality, promote correct ankle alignment, and <b>prevent muscle contractures by slowly stretching
                hypertonic muscles</b>.
            <br> - -> <b>Solid AFOs (SAFOs)</b> can neutralize ankle angle and improve knee flexion.
            <br> - -> <b>Hinged AFOs (HAFOs)</b> prevent equine deformity and increase gait symmetry.
            <br> - -> <b>Dynamic AFOs (DAFOs)</b> modify late stance, improve push-off power, and are suitable for
            crouched gait patterns. DAFOs have shown to improve hip extension, ankle dorsiflexion during swing, and
            overall gait kinematics, and are often preferred by parents for comfort and lightness. They have also
            demonstrated effectiveness in improving gross motor function (crawling, kneeling, standing, walking,
            running, jumping).
            <br> - -> <b>Ground Reaction AFOs (GRAFOs)</b> have been shown to be more effective than classic AFOs in
            achieving and maintaining balance control, by promoting optimal knee alignment and extension.
            <br> - <b>KAFOs</b> are used to protect articular range of motion, support impaired muscles, improve knee
            extension during standing and walking, and prevent knee hyperextension, stabilizing knee and ankle joints
            for upright posture. However, one study found KAFO braces to be <b>poorly tolerated and uncomfortable</b>,
            and they did not produce significant differences in preventing clubfoot when used nightly.
            <br> - While studies show a general improvement in motor functions, walking, and balance with orthosis use,
            <b>high heterogeneity</b> in study designs, types of orthoses, and assessment tools makes it difficult to
            identify a consistently more effective type or to conduct meta-analyses for definitive conclusions. Many
            included studies had a high risk of bias, often lacking blinding and objective outcome measures.

            <br><br><b>Other Nonsurgical Treatments:</b>
            <br> - <b>Shockwave Therapy:</b> A systematic review found a nonsignificant short-term effect of <b>2°
                PROM</b> from a single RCT. While including non-randomized studies increased the effect to 12°, the
            overall quality of evidence is limited and susceptible to bias. Some studies noted immediate and short-term
            significant improvements, but long-term sustained effects were not always found.
            <br> - <b>Physical Activity:</b> Pooled data from RCTs showed a nonsignificant effect of <b>3° PROM</b> on
            joint mobility, with high heterogeneity. Exercise is known to improve micro-vascularization and oxidative
            capacity of muscles, which can be beneficial where poor micro-vascularization is a factor.
            <br> - <b>Botulinum Toxin (BTX) Treatment:</b> Pooled RCT data indicated a nonsignificant effect of <b>4°
                PROM</b> on joint mobility.
            <br> - <b>Electrical Stimulation (FES, NMES, TENS, RPMES):</b> Pooled RCT data showed a nonsignificant
            effect of <b>3° PROM</b> on joint mobility. While it temporarily improves passive range of motion, benefits
            may reduce once treatment stops, though it can help prevent muscle atrophy.
            <br> - <b>Robot-assisted Rehabilitation:</b> Pooled RCT data showed a small, clinically non-important effect
            of <b>1° PROM</b> on joint mobility.
            <br> - <b>Miscellaneous Interventions:</b>
            <br> - -> <b>Passive cycling</b> showed significant improvements in hip and ankle PROM for individuals with
            spinal cord injury.
            <br> - -> <b>Mirror therapy</b>, particularly when combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation, had a
            significant effect on ankle dorsiflexion PROM.
            <br> - -> <b>High-dose diazepam</b> (an antispasticity drug) significantly increased PROM in children with
            CP.
            <br> - -> <b>Traditional Chinese acupuncture</b> and <b>dry needling</b> showed significant increases in
            some PROM measures in stroke patients.
            <br> - -> Other interventions like neural tension technique, serious games, whole body vibration, combined
            stretching and resistance training, and high-intensity pulse irradiation with near-infrared rays did not
            show significant effects on joint mobility.
