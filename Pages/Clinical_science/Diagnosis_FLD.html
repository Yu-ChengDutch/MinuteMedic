        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>In this condition, fat builds up in the liver. In general, this condition is <b>asymptomatic</b> but it carries many possible grave complications. Risk factors include <b>alcohol use, DM type II, and obesity</b>. Similarly, <b>glucocorticoids and hepatitis C</b> may <u>cause</u> FLD.</p>
        
        <h2>Complications</h2>

        <p>When symptoms develop, they are usually limited to <b>fatigue, or right upper quadrant pain</b>. However, complications are more problematic:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Hepatic fibrosis</li>
            <li>Hepatic cirrhosis</li>
            <li>Hepatocellular carcinoma</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Hepatic cirrhosis</h3>

        <p>The end stage to <b>chronic liver disease</b>, it results from impaired repair of liver tisue and hence formation of scar tissue. The parenchyma is replaced by scar tissue and nodules of regenerating hepatocytes, which causes resistance in the capillaries and hence impairment of blood flow. Usually <b>slowly progressive</b>, symptoms are often slow to emerge.</p>
        <p>Early symptoms may include <b>fatigue, weakness, loss of apetite, weight loss, and nausea</b>. A characteristic sign is <b><u>palmar erythema</u></b>. Neurological signs occur <b>later in disease progression</b>, with <b>oedema</b> and <b>ascites</b> occuring around the same time. Other advanced signs include <b>icterus, itchy skin, hypogonadism, spider angiomata, gynaecomastia (2/3 of cases), hepatomegaly, easy bruising, and dark urine</b>. Pathophysiologically, cirrhosis causes <b>increased conversion of androgens into estrogen</b>, causing the sex related symptoms. Similarly, cirrhosis causes <b>hyperbilirubinemia</b> in this case is due to a <b>post-hepatic cause</b> and thus consists of elevated <u>conjugated</u> bilirubin. <b>Ascites, splenomegaly, esophageal varices, caput medusae and Cruveilhier-Baumgarten bruit</b> are all signs of resulting <b>portal hypertension</b>.</p> 
        <p>As the disease progresses, the liver starts functioning less: <b>decreased production of clotting factors, namely the liver-produced ones i.e., II, V, VI, VII, IX, X (bruising, bleeding), build-up of ammonia (hepatic encephalopathy with <u>negative myoclonus / asterixis</u>, hepatorenal syndrome, and cachexia</b>.</p>

        <p>Diagnosis is made using ultra-sound guided biopsy, which should show:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Presence of regenerating nodules of hepatocytes</li>
            <li>Presence of fibrosis</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Then, the disease is staged using the <b>Child-Pugh score</b> which is based on lab values, ascites and severity of encephalopathy. When complications cannot be controlled, then transplantation is necessary. Of this, five year survival is around <b>80%</b>, and necessitates the use of immunosuppressants like ciclosporin/tacrolimus.</p>

        <h3>Hepatocellular carcinoma</h3>

        <p>The <b>most common type of primary liver cancer in adults</b> is the most common death cause in people with hepatic cirrhosis, and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Symptomatology is essentially the same as in chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, with additional abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or fatigue. Aetiologically, we see that 80% of cases is <b>viral</b>, which other causes include <b>toxins (alcohol, aflatoxin, hemochromatosis), metabolic (MASH, DM type II), or congenital disorders (M. Wilson, haemophilia)</b>. When we look at the viral origins, it is mostly <b>hepatitis B</b> and <b>heptatitis C</b>.</p>

        <p>Pathophysiologically, hepatitis C causes carcinoma by a <b>constant cycle of damage and repair</b> where the risks for mistakes during repair originate. Then, for hepatitis B, <b>the viral genome may integrate directly into infected cells</b>. It is then staged using the <b>Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classificaiton</b>, which integrates <b>life performance status (ECOG), Child-Pugh class, and "nodularty" (i.e., single nodule, multi-nodule, portal invasion etc.)</b>. Preferred treatment is usually surgical resection, but residual liver volume ought to <b>exceed 25% in a non-cirrhotic liver</b>. or even <b>exceed 40% in a cirrhotic liver</b>. Then, 5 year survival is 60%.</p>

        <h1>Alcoholic Steatohepatitis</h1>

        <p>Also simply called alcoholic liver disease, <b>90%</b> of heavy drinkers develop at least steatosis, while <b>25%</b> develop steatohepatitis, and <b>15%</b> progress to cirrhosis. Risk factors include <b>quantity of alcohol taken, pattern of drinking (i.e., drinking outside of meals), sex (women are twice as susceptible), ethnicity, hepatitis C infection, genetic factors and malnutrtition</b>.</p>

        <p>Pathophysiologically, alcohol metabolism in the liver involves the conversion of NAD into NADH. The presence of NADH then, increases fatty acid synthesis. It also causes oxidative stress, which causes hepatocyte injury. An intermediate product, acetaldehyde, may induce fibrosis by stimulating collagen deposition.</p>

        <h1>Metabolic dysfunction-associated staetotic liver disease (MASLD)</h1>

        <p>MASLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions of liver disease without a known secondary cause (i.e., viral or toxic). This spectrum encompasses MASL (steatosis) to MASH (steatohepatitis), which may then lead to cirrhosis and HCC.</p>

        <p>Pathophysiologically, MASLD is incompletely understood. <b>OSAS</b> or <b>snoring</b> may independantly cause oxidative stress, while <b>fructose consumption</b> increases <b><i>de novo</i> lipogenesis, and reduced beta-oxidation of fat</b>. Diet thus, is a large risk factor. Lastly, DM type II: <b>insulin resistance</b> promotes the release of free fatty acids into the blood stream (>50% of hepatic lipid deposition), and promotes <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis. Together, they constitute the deposited fat in the liver.</p>

        <p>Just as with alcoholic liver disease, primary treatment is lifestyle-related.</p>
