        <h1>Pharmacogenetics</h1>

        <p>
            The <b>response to a medicine can vary greatly among patients</b>, and a portion of these differences can be
            explained by variations in an individual's <b>genetic profile (DNA)</b>. Pharmacogenetics investigates how
            differences in genetic profiles account for interindividual variations in drug effectiveness and side
            effects.
            Identifying a specific genetic variation in a patient can impact the <b>dosage</b> or even lead to
            prescribing a
            different drug unaffected by that variation.
            <br><br>
            The goal of pharmacogenetic research is to achieve <b>tailored drug therapy</b> for individual patients,
            based
            on their DNA profile. By predicting beforehand who might experience insufficient drug effectiveness or
            severe
            side effects, pharmacotherapy can be applied more safely and effectively. Pharmacogenetics also contributes
            to
            the development of new personalized medicines.
        </p>

        <h2>Background information pharmacogenetics</h2>

        <h3>DNA and genetic variation</h3>
        <p>
            The human genome consists of 23 chromosome pairs made up of <b>genes</b>, which are hereditary material. A
            gene
            is a part of the genome that codes for an inherited trait. An <b>allele</b> is a specific variant of a gene,
            and
            an individual typically has two alleles for each autosomal gene (one from each parent). Human DNA is
            composed of
            a sequence of nucleotides: thymine (T), adenine (A), guanine (G), or cytosine (C).
            <br><br>
            <b>Genetic variation</b> refers to differences in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. An anomaly is called a
            <b>mutation</b> if it occurs in less than 1% of the population, but if it occurs in at least 1% of a
            population,
            it is a <b>genetic polymorphism</b>. Genetic variations arise from three main types of changes in individual
            DNA:
            <br>The most common is the <b>substitution</b> of one nucleotide by another, known as a <b>'Single
                Nucleotide
                Polymorphism' (SNP)</b>.
            <br>Nucleotides can be <b>deleted ('deletie')</b> or <b>added ('insertie')</b> to a gene. There can also be
            a
            <b>duplication</b> of the same gene, <b>multiple copies ('multiplicatie')</b>, or deletion of the entire
            gene.
            These last three, where the number of gene copies on the chromosome deviates from one, are collectively
            termed
            <b>'copy number variations'</b>.
            <br>The third type is the formation of <b>repetitions of shorter DNA segments</b>, known as <b>'(tandem)
                repeats'</b>, which usually occur in a gene's promoter and can influence <b>gene expression</b> and thus
            the
            amount of enzyme or protein produced.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, genetic variations can lead to changes in the production and/or abnormal activity of
            <b>proteins</b>, such as drug-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins, receptors, and other drug targets.
        </p>

        <h3>Genotype</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>genotype</b> is the hereditary information about a specific trait of an individual, or the genetic
            profile of a particular gene. A gene consists of two alleles, one on each chromosome of a pair. Genetic
            variation leads to different alleles of a gene. The <b>'wildtype'</b> refers to the DNA sequence of the most
            common allele in a population, which results in an active protein. The presence of a genetic polymorphism
            indicates a <b>variant allele</b>. For example, if a wildtype allele (A) has an 80% frequency, the wildtype
            genotype AA occurs in 64% of the population. A variant allele (T) with a 20% frequency would result in the
            TT
            genotype occurring in 4% of the population. The <b>heterozygous genotype</b> combines one wildtype allele
            and
            one variant allele (e.g., AT), occurring in 32% of the population in this example.
            <br><br>
            <b>Star notation</b> is often used to denote variant alleles, such as CYP2D6*4 or CYP2C9*2 for cytochrome
            P450
            genes. Variant alleles have suffixes like '*2, *3, *4', etc., indicating the order of discovery, while the
            wildtype allele is *1. Genotypes are categorized as <b>wildtype</b> (e.g., *1/*1: no variants), <b>double
                variant</b> (e.g., *4/*4: homozygous variant), and <b>mixed</b> (e.g., *1/*4: heterozygous).
        </p>

        <h3>(Predicted) phenotype</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>phenotype</b> is the expression of a particular genotype, such as the functionality of a protein
            (e.g.,
            an enzyme or receptor). The phenotype is determined by the genotype, the degree of gene expression, and
            environmental factors like co-medication, diet, smoking, and comorbidity. For successful practical
            application
            of pharmacogenetics, a clear relationship between genotype and phenotype is crucial, as this allows the
            phenotype to be well predicted by genotyping. <b>Predicted phenotype</b> means that a patient's metabolic
            phenotype can be predicted based on their determined genotype.
            <br><br>
            For most enzymes, a population can be divided into three <b>(predicted) phenotype groups</b>:
            <br><b>'Poor metabolisers' (PM)</b> (slow metabolizers): exhibit greatly reduced or absent metabolic
            activity,
            typically having two inactive alleles.
            <br><b>'Intermediate metabolisers' (IM)</b> (intermediate metabolizers): have reduced metabolic activity,
            possessing combinations like two reduced active alleles, one reduced active and one inactive allele, or one
            active and one inactive allele.
            <br><b>'Extensive/normal metabolisers' (EM or NM)</b> (normal metabolizers): show normal metabolic activity
            and
            usually have two wildtype alleles. This is the most common phenotype and serves as the normal reference for
            comparison.
            <br><br>
            A <b>fourth group</b> is possible for some enzymes:
            <br><b>'Ultrarapid metabolisers' (UM)</b> (fast metabolizers): display increased metabolic activity, usually
            due
            to gene duplication of wildtype or increased-activity alleles, in the absence of inactive alleles.
            <br><br>
            With <b>reduced metabolic enzyme activity (poor or intermediate metabolizers)</b>, side effects can occur
            sooner
            due to elevated plasma concentrations, or a drug may be ineffective or less effective if it's a prodrug. An
            example of a prodrug is clopidogrel, which requires conversion by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to its active
            metabolite.
            <br><br>
            With <b>increased metabolic enzyme activity (ultrarapid metabolizers)</b>, a drug that is a substrate for
            the
            enzyme is metabolized faster into its metabolite. This can reduce its efficacy or, if it's a prodrug,
            increase
            its efficacy.
        </p>

        <h3>Ethnic variation</h3>
        <p>
            The distribution of polymorphisms can vary significantly between different ethnic groups. For example, 5-10%
            of
            the Caucasian population are 'poor metabolizers' for the enzyme CYP2D6, compared to only 1-2% of the Asian
            population. For the same enzyme, 5-10% of Caucasians are 'ultrarapid metabolizers,' whereas this applies to
            20-30% of North Africans. Another example is CYP2C19, for which 2-3% of the Western population are 'poor
            metabolizers,' compared to 10-25% of Asians. Therefore, non-Caucasian ancestry can indicate a higher chance
            of a
            particular gene variant.

        <h2>Gene-drug interactions</h2>
        <p>
            Genetic variations and their interactions with drugs can be categorized into three groups: pharmacokinetic
            gene-drug interactions, pharmacodynamic gene-drug interactions, and various indirect effects of genetic
            variations.
        </p>

        <h3>Pharmacokinetic gene-drug interactions</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Pharmacokinetics</b> describes the processes a drug undergoes in the body: <b>absorption, distribution,
                metabolism (Phase I and Phase II), and excretion</b>. Drug plasma concentrations are a result of these four
            processes. Genetic variations in genes coding for proteins involved in these processes can lead to altered
            plasma concentrations and thus differences in drug response.
        </p>

        <h4>Phase I metabolism and enzymes</h4>
        <p>
            The <b>cytochrome P450 enzyme system</b> is crucial for drug metabolism in the liver, primarily involved in
            Phase I metabolism (oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis of drugs). Key enzymes involved in the metabolism of
            many drugs include <b>CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2</b>. Varying activity of CYP enzymes is a
            well-known example of altered drug metabolism due to DNA variation. Many genetic polymorphisms are known for
            CYP450 enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, leading to different metabolic activities. Based on metabolic
            activity, these enzymes are classified into the four phenotype groups: poor, intermediate, extensive/normal, and
            ultrarapid metabolizers.
            <br><br>
            Other Phase I enzymes with known genetic polymorphisms include <b>dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)</b> and
            <b>pseudocholinesterase</b>. DPD breaks down fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil, capecitabine, tegafur) into
            inactive metabolites. Reduced DPD function increases the risk of severe or life-threatening toxicity with
            standard doses of these drugs, making treatment contraindicated for patients with total DPD deficiency. For
            those with partial DPD deficiency (5-10% of Dutch patients), a reduced initial dose or an alternative drug is
            advised.
            <br><br>
            Lowered <b>pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase or BChE)</b> activity reduces the breakdown of muscle
            relaxants like suxamethonium and mivacurium, leading to prolonged muscle relaxation and need for ventilation.
            These drugs should be avoided in cases of pseudocholinesterase deficiency, which has a genetic cause in half of
            the cases.
        </p>

        <h4>Phase II metabolism and enzymes</h4>
        <p>
            Phase II enzymes are involved in <b>conjugation reactions</b> in the liver (glucuronidation, acetylation,
            methylation, and sulfation). These reactions attach an endogenous substrate to the drug, making it more
            water-soluble for easier excretion via urine or bile. Genetic variations in several Phase II enzymes are known
            to influence drug response:
            <br><b>Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)</b>: This enzyme methylates (inactivates) thiopurines (azathioprine,
            6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine). Reduced or absent TPMT activity with normal thiopurine dosing leads to
            accumulation of thioguanine in hematopoietic tissue, causing severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression.
            <br><b>Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGT)</b>, including isoenzyme UGT1A1, are involved in the
            glucuronidation of many drugs and endogenous substrates. Irinotecan is a prodrug converted to the active
            metabolite SN-38. SN-38 is mainly metabolized by UGT1A1 into the inactive SN-38-glucuronide. UGT1A1 deficiency
            leads to increased SN-38 plasma concentrations and a higher risk of severe irinotecan side effects like
            neutropenia and diarrhea. Atazanavir also inhibits UGT1A1, increasing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and
            jaundice.
        </p>

        <h3>Transport proteins</h3>
        <p>
            Transport proteins are located in cell membranes and facilitate the cellular uptake of endogenous substances and
            various drugs, playing a role in <b>drug absorption, distribution, and excretion</b>. Examples of transport
            proteins with described polymorphisms include <b>P-glycoprotein (Pgp)</b> and <b>hepatic Solute Carrier Organic
                Anion Transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1)</b>.
            <br><br>
            Pgp transport proteins, encoded by the ABCB1-gene, contribute to transporting drugs back into the intestinal
            lumen and excreting them via the kidneys. Genetic variations in the ABCB1 gene can thus affect drug plasma
            concentrations. Evidence suggests interactions between ABCB1 and clopidogrel, and ABCB1 and digoxin.
            <br><br>
            The transport protein <b>SLCO1B1 (also known as OATP1B1)</b> is mainly found in hepatocyte membranes and is
            responsible for statin uptake into liver cells. Genetic polymorphism in the SLCO1B1 gene can lead to reduced
            statin transport to the liver, increasing plasma concentration and thus the risk of myopathy.
        </p>

        <h3>Pharmacodynamic gene-drug interactions</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Pharmacodynamics</b> concerns the pharmacological effects of a drug in the body by acting on targets such as
            receptors, enzymes, or ion channels. Pharmacodynamic gene-drug interactions occur at this level, for example,
            due to reduced receptor presence or binding affinity, influencing drug response. An example is the differing
            response to vitamin K antagonists (acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon) due to genetic variation in the gene coding
            for a protein in the enzyme vitamin K-2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR), the target of these antagonists.
        </p>

        <h3>Indirect effects of genetic variations</h3>
        <p>
            Beyond pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, genetic variations not directly related to
            pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics can also alter drug response. These are <b>idiosyncratic or abnormal
                reactions</b>, not necessarily dose-related, such as:
            <br><b>Acute hemolysis</b> caused by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency when using primaquine.
            <br><b>Severe hypersensitivity reactions</b> to drugs due to <b>HLA polymorphisms</b>. For instance, abacavir is
            contraindicated in carriers of the HLA-B*5701 variant allele due to severe, potentially life-threatening
            hypersensitivity reactions. Carriers of HLA-B*1502, HLA-A*3101, and HLA-B*1511 have an increased risk of
            Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) when using carbamazepine. The same applies
            to carriers of HLA-B*5801 with allopurinol.
            <br><b>Increased clotting tendency</b> due to the Factor V Leiden mutation, a variant allele that delays
            inactivation of activated coagulation factor V. Carriers of the Factor V Leiden mutation have an increased risk
            of venous thrombosis.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications of pharmacogenetics</h2>
        <p>
            Pharmacogenetic research is relevant for several reasons, such as explaining unexpectedly severe side effects or
            ineffectiveness, or for proactively determining the correct dosage or choosing an alternative drug for a
            patient. Some drugs are now registered with pharmacogenetic information in their package inserts.
            Pharmacogenetic knowledge is increasingly applied in advising on drug choice, initial dosage, or during therapy
            evaluation.
            <br><br>
            <b>Genotyping</b> involves pharmacogenetic testing (using blood, saliva, or cheek swab) to determine which
            alleles of a specific gene a patient possesses. This screens for the most common variant alleles of one or more
            enzymes, for example, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, and CYP2C19*17. If none of these variant alleles are found, the
            genotyping result is reported as *1/*1 (wildtype). Because genotyping usually only screens for the most common
            allele variants, the found genotype may sometimes differ from the actual genotype.
        </p>

        <h3>Genotyping for pharmacotherapeutic problems</h3>
        <p>
            An important application of pharmacogenetic research is to determine a patient's metabolizer category. For
            instance, if lower than normal therapeutic serum concentrations occur at a usual drug dosage, in addition to
            non-adherence, <b>ultrarapid metabolism</b> can be considered as an explanation. Conversely, if normal drug
            dosages result in excessively high serum concentrations, <b>slow metabolism</b> can be explained by
            pharmacogenetic results indicating reduced active or inactive enzymes.
            <br><br>
            For various antidepressants and antipsychotics, a clear link exists between the genotype-predicted cytochrome
            P450 phenotype and abnormal metabolism. However, genotype only partially determines metabolic capacity.
            Therefore, dosage adjustment recommendations based on genotype are a guide to achieve the desired plasma
            concentration, but individual dose adjustment may still be necessary. For drugs where plasma concentration
            monitoring is common and there is a link between plasma concentration and effect or side effects,
            <b>'therapeutic drug monitoring' (TDM)</b> can be useful to optimize dosage, even after pharmacogenetic
            analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Genotyping before starting drug treatment</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, pharmacogenetics was primarily used to explain whether an abnormal drug response was due to an
            altered genetic profile, applying it diagnostically. In recent years, pharmacogenetic tests are increasingly
            used <b>before starting drug treatment</b> to determine the individual initial dosage (e.g., DPYD genotyping for
            fluoropyrimidines, UGT1A1 genotyping for irinotecan).
            <br><br>
            Another application of pharmacogenetics is to proactively determine who should or should not receive a certain
            drug. For some drugs, the presence of a specific genetic variant is a <b>contraindication</b>. An example is
            abacavir, which causes severe hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*5701 carriers, thus it can only be used if the
            patient is not a carrier of this allele. Another example is the HLA-B*1502 allele and the risk of
            Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis from carbamazepine.

        <h3>Pharmacotherapeutic advice for known genotype</h3>
        <p>
            The Pharmacogenetics working group of the KNMP aims to assist doctors and pharmacists with the practical
            application of pharmacogenetics by providing pharmacotherapeutic advice. These advisories are not a call to
            perform genotyping but are intended to apply pharmacogenetic knowledge when a patient's genotype is already
            known for any reason. Initially, the working group focused on pharmacokinetic gene-drug interactions where dose
            adjustment was advised, but this has expanded to include other types of interactions, such as those between
            abacavir and HLA-B, and between vitamin K antagonists and the enzyme vitamin K-2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR).
            <br><br>
            Advice for pharmacists and prescribers is distributed as part of the G-standard (an electronic file with
            information on dispensable products), making it electronically available during prescribing and medication
            monitoring. If a pharmacogenetic dosing recommendation applies to a specific drug, it is noted in the
            <b>Farmacotherapeutisch Kompas</b> under the 'Dosering' section of the relevant drug text. Additionally, any
            pharmacogenetic information included in the manufacturer's product information (SmPC) is presented in the
            'Bijwerkingen' (Side Effects), 'Contra-indicaties' (Contraindications), and/or 'Waarschuwingen en voorzorgen'
            (Warnings and Precautions) sections.
