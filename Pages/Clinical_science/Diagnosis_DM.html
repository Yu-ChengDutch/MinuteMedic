        <h1>Diabetes mellitus</h1>

        <p>Insulin was first synthesised in 1922, but DM remains the 7th leading cause of death in the US. Several subtypes of DM exist:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>DM type I</li>
            <li>DM type II (90% of all DM)</li>
            <li>MODY: Mature-onset Diabetes of the Young (type II)</li>
            <li>LADA: Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of the Adult (type I)</li>
            <li>Gestational diabetes</li>
            <li>Neonatal diabetes</li>
            <li>Secondary (iatrogenic) DM</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Pathophysiology and aetiology</h2>

        <p>The <b>pancreas</b>, which lies retroperitoneally save for the tail, contains two main subclasses of cells: <b>beta cells (producing insulin)</b> and <b>alpha cells (producing glucagon)</b>. DM is then characterised by an absence or impairment of insulin, which then leads to hyperglycaemia. Insulin itself is a <b>peptide hormone</b> functioning as the main anabolic hormone of the body, and <b>promotes the absorption of glucose from the blood into the cells of the liver, fat and skeletal muscles</b>. In these tissues, glucose may then be converted either into <b>glycogen</b> or <b>fats</b>, while in the liver it is converted into both. Furthermore insulin <b>inhibits strongly</b> glucose production and secretion in the liver.</p>

        <p>In essence, these cells in the islets function as such:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Beta cells: secrete insulin when blood glucose is <b>high</b></li>
            <li>Alpha cells: secrete glucose when blood glucose is <b>low</b></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Glucagon then stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. Together, these mechanisms form an important part of <b>glucose homeostasis</b>. Beyond its role in glucose homeostasis, insulin also <b>increases DNA replication</b>, <b>protein synthesis</b> and <b>modifies enzymatic activity</b>. Furthermore, it <b>stimulates lipogenesis</b>, <b>decreases autophagy</b>, <b>increase potassium uptake</b>, and <b>decreases renal sodium excretion</b>.</p>
        
        <p>DM type I then entails complete auto-immune destruction of beta cells, while DM type II is characterised by a <b>functional</b> deficit in insulin, often from obesity or aging. MODY then, is <b>non-insulin dependent DM, diagnosed <u>under 25 y/o</u></b>. Gestational diabetes manifests during pregnancy, and likely has to do with <b>HLA antigens</b> or an excess of <b>sex hormones</b>.</p>

        <h1>Statistics</h1>

        <p>In case of DM type I, <b>45%</b> of patients present before <b>10 y/o</b>, and there are no apparent gender differences. The incidence worldwide has been increasing, rising by about 2% annually.</p>

        <p>Similarly, DM type II has strongly been onthe rise with apparent ethnic differences in prevalence where environmental factors play a large role.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">

        <h1>Symptoms and diagnosis</h1>

        <p>Characteristic for DM are <b>polyuria, polydipsia and weigh loss</b>. We might find poor skin turgor due to dehydration, and in case of <b>ketosis</b> even a distinct <b>fruity odor of their breath</b>. Furthermore, in case of <b>ketoacidosis</b> we might find <b>Kussmaul breathing, fatigue, nausea and vomiting</b>.</p>

        <p>In terms of <b>chronic management</b> and in case of chronically elevated blood sugar levels, we might find the following problems:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Diabetic retinopathy: dilated or occluded retinal venules, with or without vascular neogenesis</li>
            <li>Etc.

        </ol>

        <p>DM type II typically presents in patients who are overweight/obese, who may present with <b>acanthosis nigricans (i.e., hyperpigmented, velvety patches on the neck/axilla/inguinal folds</b> or other signs of chronic insulin resistance.</p>

        <h2>Labwork</h2>

        <p>The Dutch guidelines recommend a diagnosis of DM type 2 after <b>2 repeated measurements of fasted glucose >7 mmol/L on two different days without other symptoms</b> or <b>a single fasted glucose of >7 mmol/L or a single random glucose >11.1 mmol <u>with</u> symptoms</b>.</p>

        <p>For chronic management, we strive to attain a blood gluces of <b>fasted between 4.5 - 8 mmol/L</b> or <b>2 hours postprandial below 9 mmol/L</b>. For HbA1c, which is arguably a better measurement for chronic use, we strive for the following values:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Below 70 y/o (or above with <b>only</b> Metforming): below 53 mmol/mol</li>
            <li>Above 70 y/o with DM-related polyfarmacy: 54-58 mmol/mol (or below 64 mmol/mol if they've had DM >10 years)</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>

        <p>For DM type I, primary treatment is insulin. For DM type II, the Dutch guidelines recommend the following:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Step 1: Metformine</li>
            <li>Step 2: Gliclazide (consider SGLT2-inhibitor in case of cardiovascular risk or obesity)</li>
            <li>Step 3: Add SGLT2-inhibitor (light Hb1Ac elevation), GLP1-agonist (mild ,,) or long-acting insulin (HbA1c >20 mmol/mol above target value)</li>
            <li>Step 4: Compound medication from step 3</li>

        </ol>

        <h1>Chronic diabetes</h1>

        <h2>Diabetic retinopathy</h2>

        <p>A leading cause of blindness in the developing world, it affects around 80% of people with type I or II DM. It presents itself primarily with <b>microaneurysms</b> in retinal blood vessels. Subsequently, <b>cotton wool spots</b> and <b>hemorraghes appear</b>, as well as lipid deposits called <b>hard exudates</b>. The end stage is characterised by <b>neovascularisation</b> which often break and bleed, causing dark floating spots, while major bleeding can completely block vision.</p>

        <p>Around 50% of patients also develop <b>macular edema</b> which may cause blurredvision when located near the centre of the visual field. Eventually, the entire processing of neogenesis, edema and scarring can cause retinal detachment.</p>

        <p>Common treatments include anti-VEGF injections, steroid injections, panretinal laser photocoagulation and a vitrectomy which can prevent 90% of severe vision loss.</p>

        <h2>Diabetic neuropathy</h2>

        <p>Affecting approximately 30% of patients, it originates from microvascular injury involving the <b>vasa nervorum</b>. While sensorimotor neuropathy is the most well-known, DM can also result in <b>autonomic neuropathy (e.g., gastroparesis or incontinence) or cranial neuropathy (most commonly the N. Oculomotorius)</b>. In turn, sensorimotor neuropathy may result in <b>neuropathic arthropathy / Charcot neuropathy</b> which primarily presents are <b>early inflammation</b>, followed by <b>periarticular destruction, bony coalesence and finally, bony remodeling</b> in a cyclical fashion. The two leading pathophysiological theories are either neurotrauma (i.e., microtrauma due to lack of proprioception) and neurovascular (i.e., autonomic dysfunction causing hyperaemia, leading to increased osteoclastic activity). It mostly occurs in the foot, and within that roughly 60% takes place in the tarsometatarsal joints. Typically, <b>neurosyphilis</b> results in the same condition in the knee, while <b>syringomyelia</b> may present with a similar condition in the shoulder.</p>

        <h2>Diabetic nephropathy</h2>

        <p>Presentating with the typical chronic kidney disease-triad of <b>proteinuria, rising hypertension, falling renal function</b>, diabetic nephropathy is caused by damage to all compartments of the kidney: vascular damage, and eventually renal fibrosis. After glomeruli become severly damaged, massive proteinuria may lead to low serum albumin, leading to generalised edema (i.e., nephrotic syndrome). Risk factors include uncontrolled hypertension, DM type I before 20 y/o, cigarette use and certain racial groups.</p>
