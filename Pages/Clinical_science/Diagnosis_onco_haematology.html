        <h1>Haematological malgnancies</h1>
        <p>There is three kinds of such malignancies:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Leukemias: malignancies located in the blood</li>
            <li>Lymphomas: malignancies located in the lymph nodes</li>
            <li>Myelomas: malignancies located in the bone marrow</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Statistically, <b>lymphomas</b> represent about <b>50%</b> of all haematological malignancies, while <b>leukemias</b> represent about <b>30%</b> and <b>myelomas</b> represent about <b>14%</b>.</p>

        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <p>What is the most common form of haematological malignancy?</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options"></li>

        <h1>Leukemia</h1>

        <p>Characteristic for leukemia is the buildup of blasts, here also referred to as <b>leukemia cells</b>. However, what ends up causing symptoms is <b>lack of normal blood cells</b>. Subtypes of leukemia are subdivided by <b>cell type</b> and <b>type of proliferation</b>:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)</li>
            <li>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</li>
            <li>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</li>
            <li>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The <b>acute</b> forms are characterised by a <b>rapid buildup of immature blood cells</b>. These then <b>crowd the bone marrow, halting production of healthy blood cells</b>, which obviously results in <b>low Hb and platelets</b>. The <b>chronic</b> form hwoever, is characterised by the excessive buildup of <b>mature white blood cells</b><./p>

        <p>Statistically, remember the following: <b>ALL occurs in children</b>, <b>AML occurs in addults</b>, <b>Chronic leukemia occurs in the elderly</b>. While not a hard-and-fast rule, it covers most cases.</p>

        <h2>Symptomatology</h2>
        <p>Symptoms are derived from two causes: <b>lack of red blood cells/platelets, excess of white blood cells</b>. The first results in <b>bruising, pale skin, enlarged spleen/liver, petechiae, anaemia (dyspnea, palor)</b> while the second results in <b>frequent infection, fever, sores etc.</b>. Concomittant <b>headaches or ventricular hypertensive symptoms</b> are an important warning sign for CNS invasion by leukemic cells.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>After clinical suspicion arises from the symtomatology, a <b>blood count</b> could show <b>leukemia (high leukocyte counts)</b> but similarly a condition called <b>aleukemia</b> exists in which the leukemic cells are still present in the bone marrow, but no leukemia shows up on a WBC count. This may occur in any subtype, but notably in <b>hairy cell leukemia</b>. A definitive diagnosis then, is only made after <b>bone marrow biopsy</b> with repeated <b>lumbar punctures</b> to monitor CNS invasion. On histology, typical for <b>myeloid variants</b> are so-called <b>Auer rods</b> which are cyrstalline, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in myeloid blasts.</p>

        <h2>Genetics</h2>
        <p>Risk factors include formaldehyde, smoking, exposure to certain nuclear isotypes etc. but similarly, a genetic risk exists. Notably, people with <b>Down's syndrome</b> have a significantly increased risk of acute leukemia, while <b>Fanconi anaemia</b> carries a large risk of developing AML. Furthermore, <b>95% of people with CML</b> carry the so-called <b>Philadelphia translocation</b> in which a gene from chromosome 9 gets translocated to chromosome 22.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="question-card">

        <h1>Question 2</h1>
        <p>Which occurs most in children?</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options"></li>
            <li data-answer="correct">ALL</li>
            <li data-answer="wrong">AML</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Lymphomae</h1>
        <p>In essence, lymphomae are cancers of the immune system. Hence, risk factors include various infections: <b>Epstein-Barr (Lyme) virus for Hodgkin</b> and <b>HIV/AIDS or immunosuppressants for non-Hodgkin</b>. Symptomatology then is notably <b>lymphadenopathy</b> but similarly, <b>B-symptoms (fever, night sweats and weight loss</b> may occur.</p>

        <p>If lymphadenopathy is present, diagnosis is made through a lymph-node biopsy.</p>

        <h2>Hodgkin lymphoma</h2>
        <p>Accounting for about <b>15%</b> of all lymphomae, the Hodgkin variant is relatively common. Notably, about <b>50% of cases are due to Epstein-Barr virus</b>. Prognosis is generally good, with 5-year survival being <b>over 90%</b>. Notably symptoms are <b>hepatosplenomegaly and <u>pain post alcohol consumption (pathognomic)</u></b>. However, what characterises Hodgkin lymphoma is the presence of <b>Reed-Sternberg cells</b> which are <b> unusually large lymphocytes with multiple nuclei, each with thickened nuclear membranes</b>.</p>

        <h2>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</h2>
        <p>This being a very heterogenous group, it is split into two main subcategories: <b>B-cell lymphocytes and T-cell lymphocytes</b>. Of these, the most common are both of the B-type and are <b>diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular lymphoma (FL).</b> The differentiating aspect is mainly histological: FL is characterised by both <b>centroblasts and centrocytes</b> while DLBCL is characterised by <b>centroblasts</b> uniquely, but spread out diffusely over the tissue. Macroscopically, FL may be recognised by a <b>follicular or lobular appearance of the lymph node</b>.</p>

        <h2>Staging of lymphomae</h2>
        <p>For both variants, the same <b>Ann-Arbour staging</b> is used:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Stage I: Cancer is located in one lymph node</li>
            <li>Stage II: Cancer is located in two regions, both on the <b>same side of the diaphragm</b></li>
            <li>Stage III: Cancer has spread to <b>both sides of the diaphragm</b> with one region near the lymph nodes or spleen</li>
            <li>Stage IV: Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Additionaly, "A" means the absence of B-symptoms, while "B" logically denotes their presence. "S" is then used to denote spread to the spleen, and "E" indicates extranodality.</p>

        <h1>Multiple Myeloma</h1>
        <p>This type of haematological carcinoma proceeds from the <b>plasma B-cell</b> and is the end-stage of a sequence of conditions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)</li>
            <li>Smouldering Myeloma (SMM)</li>
            <li>Multiple Myeloma (MM)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The old diagnostic criteria for MM are known by the acronym CRAB:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>C: Calcium -> Hypercalcaemia</li>
            <li>R: Renal insufficiency</li>
            <li>A: Anaemia</li>
            <li>B: Bone -> Osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography</li>
        </ol>

        <p>While a familial disposition to MM exists, another important risk factor is <b>obesity</b> with a 5 point increase leading to an RR increase of 11%. In order to support diagnosis, paraproteins (faulty proteins produced by the malignant cells) may be found; an example being Bence-Jones protein. However, final diagnosis is made based on bone-marrow biopsy. Histologically, the biopsy might show a <b>perinuclear halo, bizarre cells, flame cells (bright red cytoplasm) and Mott cells (multiple clustered cytoplasmic droplets).</b></p>
