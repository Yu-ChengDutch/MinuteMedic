        <h1>Types and subtypes</h1>
        <p>Dementia exists in various forms and may occur at various stages. Most causes are neurodegenerative, but external causes such as <b>syphilis, HIV and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</b> may occur. Here, we will go through the most common types to learn and discriminate them.</p>

        <h2>Testing for dementia</h2>
        <p>Two famous cognitive tests are used in the diagnosis or monitoring of patients with MCI or dementia: the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam). Of these the <b>MMSE</b> is <b>less influenced by educational level attained</b>, while the <b>MoCA</b> seems to be better suited for <b>recognition in early stages</b>. However, neither tool is useful as the sole tool for diagnosis of dementia. As for scoring, on the <b>MoCA</b>, the cutoff for <b>MSI is 26/30</b> while the cutoff for the <b>MMSE</b> is <b>24/30 for mild, 18/30 for moderate and 10/24 for severe</b>.</p>

        <h2>Alzheimer's dementia</h2>
        <p>Accouning for <b>60-70%</b> of dementia cases, AD is characterised by problems with <b>short-term memory and word-finding</b>. Pathophysiologically, the most affected part is the <b>hippocampus</b> with even the <b>temporal and parietal lobes</b> showing signs of <b>atrophy</b>. The histopathological hallmark is the <b>overproduction of amyloid</b> leading to both extracellular <b>senile plaques (SPs)</b> consisting of beta-amyloid peptides and intracellular <b>neurocellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)</b> formed by tau-proteins. What amyloid then does, is inflame these SPs which leads to brain changes. The NFTs eventually cause the microtubules to disintegrate, which destroys the cells cytoskeleton.</p>

        <p>Development is gradual but indeed progressive, with early stages being focussed on <b>memory problems</b>. In the middle stage, <b>speech difficulties</b> develop due to recall problems leading to <b>paraphasias</b> (i.e., word substitutions), as slowly <b>long-term memory is affected</b> and <b>neuropsychiatric changes</b> become more evident. In this stage, about <b>30% of patients</b> also develop <b>delusional symptoms</b>. In <u>late-stage AD</u>, <b>language is reduced to simple phrases or single words</b>, with <b>extreme apathy / exhaustion</b> being common from a neuropsychiatric point of view, as <b>mobility deteriorates</b>. The cause of death then, is usually an external factor: pressure ulcers, pneumonia etc.</p>

        <p>A 70% heritability has been shown, with the most strongly connected gene being <b>APOE-epsilon-4</b>. Early-onset AD exists as a disease entity responsible for <b>1-2% of cases</b> and is a <b>highly polygenic autosomal dominant</b> genetic condition.</p>

        <h2>Vascular dementia</h2>

        <p>Vascular dementia comes in multiple types, all of which are caused by restriction of blood flow due to strokes: <b>subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia and mixed dementia</b>. The subcortical type is caused by <b>damage to small blood-vessels in the brain</b>, the multi-infarct type is caused by <b>a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions</b>, the stroke-related type is caused by <b>successive small strokes</b> causing a gradual decline.</p>
        <p>Typical is the <b>step-wise decline over a period of 5-10 years</b>. Because the damage is localised to the site of vascular damage, symptoms may vary between patients. However cognitive decline and memory impairment are typical. Being the <b>second-most common form of dementia</b>, it is responsible for <b>20-50%</b> of all cases of dementia.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">

        <h2>Lewy body dementia</h2>
        <p>This is an umbrella-term, covering two types of dementia: dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Typical are so-called <b>Lewy-bodies</b> which are <b>spherical masses displacing other cell components</b> of which there are two types: <b>classical and cortical</b>. The classical variant is strongly eosinophilic with a 10-nm halo of fibrils, while the cortical variant does not have the same halo. Typically, these bodies are found in the <b>substantia nigra</b> or the <b>cortex</b>.</p>

        <p>Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is then marked by the deposition of these bodies in the cortex. It presents with <b>fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and parkinsonism</b>. The RBD being typical, it often occurs in the pre-demential phase together with <b>constipation and hyposmia</b> i.e., a reduced sense of smell. DLB is notably <b>not memory-focused</b> but rather presents cognitively with problems in the domains of <b>attentions, executive functions and visuospatial function</b> with a typical patient being <b>"easily distracted" with spells of agitation and confusion</b>. The RBD symptom (i.e., loss of paralysis of muscles during sleep) is so commong that <b>95% of RBD patients have a Lewy-Body related autoposy</b>. Furthermore, <b>80% of DLB patients have visual halluciations</b>, which may already occur very early on in the course of disease. Other symptoms include sensitivity to antipsychotics, dysautonomia, hypersomnia, hyposmia and postural instability.</p>
        <p>After the occurance of dementia, DLB and Parkinson's Disease Dementia are clinically similar. The difference notably, is the onset: PDD starts with motor-symptoms associated with PD and only develops dementia later. Notably, while still common, <b>hallucinations and elsuions are less marked in PDD</b> while Parkinsonisms are more common.</p>

        <p>Similar to AD, the gene <b>APO-episilon-4</b> has been shown to predispose to Lewy-body dementia.</p>

        <h2>Frontotemporal dementia</h2>
        <p>There exist many different subtypes of FD, but the three to know are: <b>Pick's disease (i.e., behavioural variant), semantic primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and nonfluent primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA)</b>. The behavioural variant may present as <u>either</u> <b>impulsive and disinhibited</b> <u>or</u> <b>apaethetic and listless</b>; both of which are caused by tau-fibril inclusion-bodies. svSDD is characterised by loss of semantic understanding, while nfvSDD results in progressive difficulties in speech production.</p>
        <p>In later stages, the subtypes <b>start to overlap</b> and all show marked differences in <b>executive functioning and working memory</b> with <b>binge eating</b> being an often-seen symptom. The first frontal-releaese sign to appear is the <b>palmomental reflex</b>.</p>
        <p>Notably, but rarely, FD may occur in people with <b>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</b> as a form of motor neuron disease.</p>

        <p>A list of six neuropsychiatric characteristics exists for Pick's disease: disinhibition, apathy, loss of sympathy/empathy, perseveration, hyperorality, dysexecutive neuropsychological profile.</p>

        <h2>Huntington's dementia</h2>
        <p>There is two main subtypes of Huntington's disease: juvinile and classical. The juvinile variant sets on before 20 y/o and presents, in the early stages, with slow, Parkinson's disease-like movement disorder, while the classical variant, setting on between 30-50 y/o, presents with a typical triad of <b>chorea, cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms</b>. In about <b>50% of patients, the psychiatric symptoms appear first</b>. As the disease progresses, chorea evolves into <b>rigidity, writhing motions and abnormal posturing</b> resulting in <b>dystonia</b> and even dysarthria. Demential symptoms only occur later: <b>short-term memory deficits, later long-term memory difficulties and working memory decline</b>. On the psychiatric side, <b>anxiety, egocentrism, aggression and compulsion</b> often appear.</p>
        <p>Aetiologically, we're looking a genetic condition where the normal Huntingtin Gene (HTT) has a repeat component, which has a variable amount of repetitions. After a certain threshold, the product is no longer a normal huntingtin protein, but a mutant variant. Such a mutation is <b>autosomal dominant</b> and <b>nearly fully penetrant</b>. Juvinile HD is then caused by a very large amount of repeats. \</p>

        <h1>External causes</h1>

        <h2>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)</h2>
        <p>A HIV-infection may cause a <b>metabolic encephalopathy</b> which is induced by the infection and fueled by immune activation of macrophages and microglia. While presenting similarly to AD, <b>visuaspatial dysfunction and alexithymia (problems with emotional recognition)</b> are characteristic for the condition. In terms of motor symptoms, early stages can show the return of the <b>snout response</b>.</p>

        <h2>Creutzfeldt-Jakob dementia</h2>
        <p>Caused, in <b>85% of cases</b>, by infection with prions, CJD may also be autosomally dominant inherited. When contracted from infected meat, it may be referred to as <b>mad cow disease</b>. Clinically, it presents with <b>progressive dementia, memory loss, ersonality changes and hallucinations</b>. What sets it apart is <b>myoclonus</b> in 90% of patients; other involuntary movements may also occur. As coughing reflexes are suppressed, most affected people die <b>6 months after onset; from pneumonia</b>.</p>

        <h2>Alcohol-related dementia</h2>
        <p>Here too, we see subtypes: alcohol-related frontal lobe damage (i.e., disinhibition, executive disfunction etc.), Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis. As for motor symptoms, heavy drinking leads to <b>peripheral neuropathy</b> and <b>cerebellar ataxia</b> and patients may be recognised by those symptoms. While those symptoms are caused by the effect of alcohol as a toxin per-se, the most famous alcohol-abuse syndromes described below are caused by alcohol-related malnutritionarry problems.</p>

        <h3>Wernicke's encephalopthy</h3>
        <p>Caused by a lack of vitiamin B1 (thiamin), it falls within a larger group including beriberi and Korsakoff's psychosis. Classically, symptoms are described as a triad: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and confusion. Typically, the ophthalmoplegia presents as <b>lateral nystagmus</b> due to paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle.</p>
    
        <h3>Korsakoff's psychosis</h3>
        <p>Often coupled with Wernicke's encephalopathy into a single syndrome, it is characterised by the neuropsychiatric consequences of B1 (thiamin) deficiency: <b>amnesia, deficitis in explicit memory, and confabulation</b>. It may similarly occur in pregant women with hyperemesis gravidarum, or in the context of mercury poisoning.</p>
