        <h1>Vitamins</h1>

        <p>A vitamin is an <b>organic molecule</b> necessary in <b>small quantities</b> for the functioning of an organism. A deficiency then, can either be <b>primary</b> when intake is insufficient or <b>secondary</b> when there is another underlying condition. These underlying disorders could be classified into:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Metabolic causes: Genetic defects etc.</li>
            <li>Lifestyle choices: Smoking, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, breastfeading etc.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>The opposite, <b>hypervitaminosis</b>, also occurs where vitamins accumulate in the body, especially <b>fat-soluble vitamins</b>.</p>

        <h1>Water-soluble vitamins</h1>

        <h2>B-vitamins</h2>

        <p>While not necessarily a <i>chemically</i> nor <i>functionally</i> related grouping, the B vitamins are grouped because they occur in similar food products (meat, dairy etc.) and where hence once thought to be a single vitamin. However, as more chemical variation was discovered, the group was split up in various subtypes.</p>

        <h3>Vitamin B1 deficiency</h3>
        <p>Also called <b>beriberi</b>, it comes in two types:</p>

        <p>It is caused by a lack of <b>vitamin B1</b> also known as <b>Thiamine</b> which, with a half-life of only <b>17 days</b>, is quickly exhausted especially when <b>intake is insufficient (e.g., white rice-based diet)</b> or <b>when demands exceeds intake (e.g., alcoholism)</b>. Thiamine is used in the <b>citric acid cycle</b>. Verstoring van deze cyclus verstoort tevens de productie van o.a. <b>GABA</b>.</p>

        <ol>
            
            <li>Wet beriberi</li>
            <li>Dry beriberi</li>
        
        </ol>

        <h4>Wet beriberi</h4>
        <p>This condition affects the <b>cardiovascular system</b>, resulting in <b>tachycardia, dyspnoe and oedema</b>. </p>
        
        <h4>Dry beriberi</h4>
        <p>This condition, of which <b>M. Korsakoff</b> is a variant, targets the <b>nervous system</b>. While Korsakoff's and Wernicke's are <b>central</b>, the hallmark symptoms for dry beriberi are mostly <b>peripheral</b>: <b>trouble with walking, paresthesias, hyporeflexia, limb paralysis and nystagmus</b>. Other, more general symptoms such as <b>wasting</b> and ataxia also occur. </p>

        <h3>Vitamin B2 deficiency</h3>
        <p>Deficiency in a vitamin known as <b>riboflavin</b> or indeed <b>vitamin B2</b> is <b>rare</b>. While an excess may be utilised to <b>prevent migraines</b>, it is very rare for a natural deficiency to arise. Similarly, no <b>toxic levels</b> have been reported in high dosages.</p>

        <h3>Vitamin B3 deficiency</h3>
        <p>Deficiency in <b>niacin</b> (i.e., vitamin B3) results in a condition called <b>pellagra</b> which is characterised by <b>inflamed skin, diarrhea, dementia and mouth sores</b>. Skin is usually first affected in areas with a lot of <b>friction or radiation</b> and may subsequently become <b>darker, stiffen, peel or bleed</b>. Treatment is done using <b>nicotinic acid</b> (a vitaminer (i.e., alternative form) of niacin) and sun protection using sunscreen.</p>

        <p>Besides a simple lack of niacin (found in meat, fish, eggs, peanuts) it may also be caused by a lack of <b>tryptophan</b> which the body uses as a <b>precursor to synthesise niacin</b>. Thirdly, an excess in <b>leucine</b> could also cause pellagra, as it prevents the transformation of nicotinic acid. In terms of secondary causes, we must look at Crohn's disease, alcoholism etc. which reduce absorption. Important is <b>M. Hartnup</b> which results in broken amino acid transport and thus <b>reduced absorption of tryptophan</b> which is essential not merely in the production of niacin, but also of serotonin etc.</p>

        <p>The typical endemic region is <b>South America</b> where <b>non-nixtamalised corn</b> as a cornerstone of the diet results in a lack of tryptophan uptake. </p>

        <p>Lastly, it's good to talk about <b>carcinoid syndrome</b> which is a <b>paraneoplastic syndrome</b> occuring secondary to <b>neuroendocrine tumours</b> which were formerly known as carcinoid tumours. These tumours, located in the gut, increase tryptophan to serotonin conversion by at least a factor of 35, which in turn causes the symptoms of <b>flushing, diarrhea and possibly heart failure</b>. At the same time, insufficient tryptophan is left to be turned into niacin, which causes <b>pellagra</b>.</p>

        <h3>Vitamin B5 deficiency</h3>
        <p>A deficiency in <b>pantothenic acid</b> is <b>vanishingly rare</b>.</p>

        <h3>Vitamin B6 deficiency</h3>
        <p>While <b>extremely rare</b> and even more rare in isolation from the other B-vitamins, it presents with <b>seborrheic dermatitis-like eruptions, atrophic glossitis with ulceration and conjuctivitis</b> and possibly occurs more in <b>various autoimmune disorders</b>.</p>

        <h3>Vitamin B7 deficiency</h3>
        <p>A deficiency in <b>biotin</b> is rare as the demand is quite low, but it does occur in the context of genetic conditions. Like B6 deficiency, it presents most strongly with <b>dermatological symptoms and conjunctivitis</b> but equally with <b>alopecia and brittle nails</b>. Potentially, it could present with nervous system symptoms like <b>myalgia and paresthesias</b>.</p>    

        <p>Potential non-genetic causes include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, excessive consumption of antidiurecs or malabsorption caused by short bowel syndrome.</p>

        <h3>Vitamin B9 deficiency</h3>
        <p>Also known as a <b>folate deficiency</b>, this is a relatively frequent occurence. When consuming to little folate, a deficiency can occur <b>within a few months</b>. Famously it leads to <b>megaloblastic anaemia</b>, possibly with <b>increased homocysteine levels</b>. It presents then with the typical symptoms of anaemia: fatigue, heart palpitations, dyspnea, feeling faint, open sores on the tongue, anorexia, behavioural changes and temporary infertility. During pregnancy, a deficiency may result in <b>low birthweight premature infants</b> or even infants with <b>neural tube defects</b>.</p>

        <p>Causes are often dietery, but may also be <b>secondary to a vitamin B12 deficiency. Furthermore, research indicates that strong UV exposure (incl. suntanning) may cause folic acid deficiency. A solution may simply be to eat more high folate foods: fruits, green leafy vegetables. During pregnancy, prevention is key. </b></p>

        <h3>Vitamin B12 deficiency</h3>
        <p>Also known as <b>cobalamin deficiency</b> is relatively common, but may be completely <b>asymptomatic</b>. Under normal conditions, the liver is able to <b>store 3-5 years worth of cobalamin</b>. Vitamin B12 then gets transformed into homocysteine (remember: becomes niacin) and methylmalonic acid which aids <b>DNA methylation and myelin production</b>.</p>

        <p>In the developed world, the most important cause is <b>pernicious anaemia</b> which is an autoimmune response producing antibodies which <b>attack the parietal cells in stomach lining</b> which prevents them from creating <b>intrinsic factor</b> which is necessary for the absorption of cobalamin. It is characterised by a triad of symptoms:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Megaloblastic anaemia</li>
            <li>Gastrointestinal symptoms: motility, diarrhea, control</li>
            <li>Neurological symptoms</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Logicially then, symptoms occur in two domains:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Anaemia: Mild</li>
            <li>Nervous system: Severe</li>
            
        </ol>

        <h4>Nervous system symptoms</h4>
        <p>Presenting with <b>paresthesias</b> early on, it can progress unto joint paint and various vague symptoms. Eventually it could result in <b>distal neuropathy, difficulty walking, poor balance, blurred vision, hyporeflexia, weakness etc.</b> and even progress onto <b>subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord (<u>myelosis funicularis</u>)</b> which is a complex consisting on 1) various forms of impaired perception, 2) dorsal column ataxia, 3) hyporeflexia and 4) pathological reflexes. This syndrome is almost <b>pathognomic</b> for B12 deficiency as opposed to folate deficiency (which may also give neuropathic symtpoms). </p>

        <h4>Anaemia</h4>
        <p>Here, a lack of cobalamin causes <b>megaloblastic anaemia</b> through a secondary folate deficiency.</p>
    
        <h2>Vitamin C deficiency</h2>
        <p>A shortage in <b>ascorbate</b>, also known as <b>scurvy</b> results in an <b>unstable form of collagen</b> produced by the body. It results in <b>malaise and lethargy</b> early on, which progresses to <b>dyspnoe, bone pain and easy bruising</b>. The later causes characteristic <b>spots on and bleeding under the skin and bleeding gums</b>, laesions which are most abundant on the thighs and legs. In advanced disease, we see <b>fever, open and suppurating wounds, loss of teeth, convulsions and eventaully death</b>. Until late in the disease, symptoms are reversible using normal vitamin C-rich diets.</p>

        <h1>Fat-soluble vitamins</h1>

        <h2>Vitamin A deficiency</h2>
        <p>While rare in richer nations, it still occurs widely in <b>poorer countries</b>, especially amongst <b>children and women of reproductive age</b>. It is involved in <b>phototransduction</b>, because of which a deficiency often results in <b>nyctalopia (i.e., nightblindness)</b>. In severe cases, it could progress unto <b>xerophthalmia, keratomalacia and complete blindness</b>. It remains the <b>leading cause of preventable childhood blindness</b> on a wordlwide scale, and is a major cause of childhood mortality.</p>

        <p>Pathognomic are so-called <b>Bitot's spots</b> which are local build-up bumps of keratin on the conjunctiva. Similarly, ulceration and necrosis of the cornea can occur. </p>

        <p>It is caused, in general, by insufficient uptake of vitamin A due to <b>iron deficiency, IBD, pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatitis etc.</b></p>

        <h2>Vitamin D deficiency</h2>

        <p>This deficiency may occur either because inadequate consumption of vitamin D, disorders that limit absorption thereof, or limited exposure to UVB rays. The elderly are particularly vulnerable, as with decreased skin thickness, sunlight absorption is similarly decreased. As vitamin D binds to fat, people with less fat mass are also more susceptible to deficiencies. A notable risk factor is <b>calcium deficiency</b> which prevents efficient uptake of vitamin D from food.</p>
        <p>Such a deficiency may cause <b>rickets</b> or <b>osteomalacia</b>. When there is insufficient vitamin D, calcium is also less absorbed in the gut. This leads to hyperactivity of the osteoclasts, which leads to bone matrix breakdown. Then, it'll lead to <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> which is a response by the body to increase serum calcium levels. </p>

        <h2>Vitamin E deficiency</h2>
        <p>While rare, a deficiency of vitamin E occurs in the context of malabsorption disorders of impaired lipid transport. It would show up as various symptoms which are also seen in other deficiencies: <b>neuromuscular problems, neurological problems, anaemia, retinopathy, immune impairment and myopathy</b>.</p>

        <h2>Vitamin K deficiency</h2>
        <p>A deficiency in vitamin K will lead to a deficiency in vitamin K-dependant clotting factors: <b>factor II, VII, IX, X and protein C and protein S</b>. This deficiency then results in <b>bruising, petechiae and hematomae</b>.</p>
