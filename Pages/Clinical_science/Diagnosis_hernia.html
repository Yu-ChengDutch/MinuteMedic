        <h1>Hernia</h1>

        <p>A herniation is the exit of tissue through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides. They most commonly involve the abdomen, specifically the groin, but may also occur in other regions. Another article has already discussed diaphragmatic ones, so we'll skip those for now!</p>
        <p>Herniation then, may be caused by increased abdominal pressure: coughing, exercise, urination or defecation. In general <b>it gets worse through the day</b> and <b>it gets better when lying down</b>. The main concern then, is <b>bowel strangulation</b>.</p>

        <p>There are many risk factors, but there also seems to be a certain <b>heritability</b> in the predisposition to herniations.</p>

        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>

        <p>Roughly <b>25% of men</b> and only <b>2.5% of women</b> will experience a groin herniation in their lives.</p>
        <p>The usual cause is a weakening of the muscular wall: smoking, ageing, overexertion, malnutrition.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>

        <p>Usually, a herniation initially presents as a <b>bulge of varying size</b> which may be reducible or irreducible. The second kind may become <b>painful</b>, especially when <b>incarcerated</b>. <b>Strangulated herniae</b> then, are <b>always painful</b> which may be followed by <b>nausea, vomiting and fever</b>, as well as a red discolouration.</p>

        <h1>Types of herniae</h1>

        <img src="Images/image_hernia_locations.png">

        <h2>Inguinal hernia</h2>

        <p>By far the most common hernia (up to <b>75%</b> of abdominal herniae), it is divided in two types:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Indirect inguinal hernia</li>
            <li>Direct inguinal hernia</li>
            <li>Pantaloon/saddlebag hernia</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Indirect inguinal hernia</h3>

        <p>In the case of an indirect inguinal hernia, abdominal contents push into the <b>inguinal canal</b> through a <b>congenital weakspot at it's <u>entrance</u></b>. This is the type occuring most often by far (<b>66% of inguinal herniae</b>) and often in a congenital context.</p>
        
        <h3>Direct inguinal hernia</h3>

        <p>In the case of a direct inguinal hernia, abdominal contents push into the inguinal canal through a <b>weakening of the wall</b> and may thus occur in the setting of aging.</p>

        <h3>Pantaloon hernia</h3>

        <p>Also called a <b>saddlebag hernia</b>, this refers to an inguinal hernia of both the indirect and direct type occuring <b>simultaneously on the same side</b>. Eponymously, it's also referred to as <b>Romberg's hernia</b>.</p>

        <h2>Femoral hernia</h2>

        <p>This hernia takes place right below the <b>ligament of Poupart</b>, which allows abdominal contents to pass into the <b>femoral canal</b> through a weakspot in the <b>posterior wall</b>. <b>Cooper's hernia</b>, then, is a femoral hernia with two sacs.</p>

        <h2>Umbilical hernia</h2>

        <p>Protruding through the site of passage of the umbilical cord, it is usually <b>acquired</b> and is more frequent in <b>the obese</b> or <b>pregnant women</b>.</p>

        <h1>Volvulus</h1>

        <p>The most dangerous complication of a hernia is <b>volvulus</b>, which results from an <b>strangulation of the bowel</b>. It usually presents with <b>abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, vomiting, constipation and bloody stool</b>. If blood flow is restricted completely, it may result in <b>ischaemic bowel</b>. This would present as <b>fever and tenderness</b>.</p>
