        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The brainstem accounts for <b>10-15%</b> of all strokes, with more ischemic than hemorrhagic incidents. As the brainstem is composed of the <b>midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata</b>, a brainstem stroke could take place in any of these. While these anatomical/functional divisions are based <b>vertically</b>, if we split the brainstem into vertical laminae we find the <b>tectum, tegmentum and basis</b>:</p>

        <img src="Images\Image_brainstem.png">

        <p>Grey matter then, is organised in clusters forming the <b>cranial nerve nuclei, pontine nuclei and reticular formation</b>. White matter, i.e., various ascending and descending tracts, is found mostly in the <b>basis lamina (anterior)</b>, and is essential in communication between the brain and spinal cord. The grey matter nuclei then, mostly lead to the cranial nerves:</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">Remember: <b>2-3-4</b> -> midbrain has 2 nuclei, we start at 3, and both the pons and medulla oblongata have 4 nuclei</div>
    
        <p>Within the brainstem, the pons is predominantly affected, with the mdulla accounting for only 7% of ischemic brain stem strokes and isolated midbrain infarctions being even more rare.</p>
        <p>In terms of aetiology, large artery atherothrombosis is the major cause of ischemic strokes. Dissecction of the vertebral arteries might lead to an infarction in the <b>medulla oblongata</b>.</p>
        <p>When talking about individual syndroms, <b>Wallenberg syndrome</b> or posterior cerebellar artery syndrome, is the most common of the brainstem strokes. The second most common then, is AICAS: anterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome.</p>

        <h1>Vascularisation</h1>

        <p>Blood supply within the brain stem is not as easy as saying a single functional region, say the pons, receives all its blood from a single artery. Instead, various parts of various regions receive blood flow from various branches of various arteries.</p>

        <p>The <b>Circle of Willis</b> is a vascular structure surrounding the optic chiasm. If we look at in relation to the brainstem, it becomes clear where the various arteries lead to. Essentially, the vertebral arteries branch of from the <b>AA. Subclavii</b>, then run through the transverse foramina of <b>C6 to C2</b> to eventually <b>pierce the dura mater</b>, then <b>at the lower body of the <u>pons</u></b>, they unite to form the <b>A. Basilaris</b>. Given that it must run parallel to the curve of the brainstem, the inferior part is not only inferior but also more posterior. The <b>A. Cerebellaris posterior inferior</b> is therefore given off by the AA. Vertebrales, while the <b>A. Cerebellaris anterior inferior</b> is given off directly after the merging of the vertebral arteries into the A. Basilaris at the inferior margin of the pons. This <b>A. Cerebellaris anterior inferior</b> also gives of the <b>Labyrinthine artery</b> to the internal auditory system. Since the upstream trajectory follows the pons, it makes sense that it gives off various <b>pontine arteries</b>. Right afterwards, it gives off the <b>A. Cerbellaris superior</b> as a <b>final branch before the Circle of Willis</b>.</p>
        <p>The Circle of Willis concerns the proper <b>cerebral blood flow</b> and consists of three <b>sets</b> of arteries: <b>Posterior cerebral, Middle cerebral, Anterior cerebral</b>. The posterior and anterior are special because they both respectively A1/A2 and P1/P2 segments, where the <b>1 segment</b> lies <b>within</b> the Circle, while the <b>2 segment</b> is the one pointing outwards. The <b>A. Cerebri media</b> is special, as it is continuous with the <b>Internal carotid artery</b> and thus provides a connection with the body, same as the <b>vertebral arteries</b>. The posterior circle is formed by the P1 segments connecting the posterior cerebral with the basilar arteries, and the <b>posterior communicating arteries</b> connecting the posterior cerebral with the middle cerebral. The anterior segment is formed by the A1 segments running between A2 and middle cerebral. In terms of accessory arteries just remember that <b>all cerebral arteries have two:</b></p>

        <ol>
        
            <li>Posterior cerebral: Posterior communicating, and posteromedial central</li>
            <li>Medial cerebral: Anterior choroidal, and ophthalmic</li>
            <li>Anterior cerebral: Recurrent a. of Heubner, and anteromedial central</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Rarely, the entire midbrain and thalamus are supplied by the <b>A. of Percheron</b>, which branches of the <b>Posterior cerebral artery</b>.</p>

        <img src="Images\image_willis.jpg">

        <h2>Medulla oblongata</h2>

        <p>Since the medulla oblongata is the most <b>inferior segment</b>, it makes sense that blood supply consists of the <b>spinal arteries, vertebral arteries and cerebellar arteries</b>. <b>Anterior medulla</b> is supplied by the <b>anterior spinal artery, and vertebral arteries</b>. The lateral part by the <b>posterior inferior cerebellar artery</b>, and the posterior bit by the <b>posterior spinal artery</b>.</p>

        <h2>Pons</h2>

        <p>As the basillar arteries starts right before the pons, it makes sense that most of the blood supply is done by the <b>pontine perforators of the basilar artery</b>.</p>

        <h2>Midbrain</h2>

        <p>The most anterosuperior segment, bloodflow to the midbrain derives mostly from the posterior cerebral artery, as well as the choroidal artery and posterior cerebellar arteries.</p>

        <h1>Syndromes and symptoms</h1>

        <p>This is where it gets challenging, as there are many different syndromes. In temrs of </p>

        <h2>Midbrain syndromes</h2>

        <p><b>Claude syndrome</b> affects the <b>posterior cerebral artery</b> and causes disruption of the fibres from the <b>CN III, and various motor fibres</b>. It causes <b>ipsilateral CN III palsy (N. Oculomotorius -> Ptosis and hypoexotropia), and contralateral hemiplegia and ataxia</b></p>
        <p><b>Benedict syndrome</b> a similar area, but only targets the <b>CN III and red nucleus</b>. It presents as <b>ipsilateral CN III palsy, and contralateral tremor/ataxia</b></p>
        <p><b>Weber syndrome</b> or <b>ventral midbrain syndrome</b> is essential Claude syndrome, but with possible invovlement of the substantia nigra, resulting in more Parkinson-like symptoms contralaterally</p>

        <h2>Pontine syndromes</h2>
        <p><b>Locked-in syndrome</b> affects the <b>upper ventral pons</b> and targets essentially the white matter tracts plus the CN VI nuclei. It results in quadriplegia, bilateral facial palsy and horizontal eye palsy. Affected is the <b>A. Basilaris</b></p>
        <p><b>Raymond syndrome</b> is essentially and an ipsilateral lateral gaze palsy and contralateral hemiparesis / facial palsy, as it targets the CN VI fibers and the corticospinal/corticofacial fibres.</p>
        <p><b>AICAS or Marie-Foix or lateral pontine syndrome</b> affects the nulcei of CN VII and VIII, corticospinal/spinothalamic/cerebellar tracts and results in contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral loss of proprioception and vibration, ipsilateral limb ataxia, ipsilateral facial palsy. It also presents with hearing loss, vertigo and nystagmus. </p>

        <h2>Medulla oblongata</h2>
        <p><b>Wallenberg syndrome</b> is ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, and facial loss of nociception; while contralateral corporal loss of nociception. It also presents with nystagmus, dysarthria, dysphagia and hyperacusis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">

        <h1>Risk assessment</h1>

        <h2>Bubble study</h2>
        <p>A solution with air bubbles is injected in a vein in the right arm. Patient is asked to cough, which reduces pressure in right side of the heart. Normally, bubbles can be traced through the right atrium, then ventricle and then lungs. When a <b>patent foramen ovale</b> is present, the bubbles can be seen crossing over to the left. This PTO increases risk of stroke and is present in about <b>25% of people</b>. This is because a clot formed in body circulation can bypass the lungs, and directly go to the brain.</p>
