        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Essentially, a pulmonary embolism is an <b>arterial blockage</b> in the lungs that has moved from <b>somewhere else in the body</b>. Usually, it originates from the legs.</p>

        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>

        <p>Roughly <b>90%</b> of pulmonary emboli are resultant from a <b>proximal deep vein thrombosis</b> (i.e., located from the knee and up). In young men without any other health conditions, however, one must suspect a <b>venous thoracic outlet syndrome</b> which is rare.</p>
        <p>DVT, and thus VTE, is much more common in <b>immunocompromised, those undergoing orthopaedic surgery at or below the hip </b> (because of immobility and/or venous damage)<b>, pancreatic and colon cancer patients</b> (increased release of pro-coagulants), <b>patients with high-grade tumours, pregnant women</b> (hypercoagulable state to decrease risk of hemorrhage during childbirth), <b>those on estrogen medication</b>. Other risk factors are <b>varicose veins, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, traumatic hip fractures that immobilise the patient and joint fixation</b>. In general, however, a search for secondary causes is only briefly conducted. Only when a second event happens, under anticoagulants, is a thorough search conducted.</p>

        <p>Pathophysiologically, the clot originates <b>in the venous system</b>, which then travels through the <b>vena cava inferior</b>, after which it enters the <b>right atrium</b>, passes the <b>tricuspid valve</b>, then passes the <b>right ventricle</b>, which then passes the <b>pulmonary valve</b> entering the <b>pulmonary artery</b> where it ends up getting stuck.</p>

        <h2>Symptomatology</h2>
        <h3>DVT</h3>

        <p>A DVT may present with a leg that is <b>red, warm, swollen and painful</b>, which is then followed by a PE.</p>

        <h3>PE</h3>
        <p>The onset typically, is <b>sudden</b>, and my include the following: <b>dyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain of pleuritic nature (i.e., worse on breathing), coughing and hemoptysis</b>. When severity increases, signs such as <b>cyanosis, collapse and circulatory instability</b>. In the end, <b>sudden death</b> may follow. Roughly <b>15%</b> of all sudden death cases are attributable to PE. Syncope, however, is rare, as <b>less than 1%</b> of syncope cases are attributable to PE.</p>
        <p>On physical examination then, one might find a <b>pleural frction rub</b> over the affected area, especially when infarcted. The affected area then also shows <b>decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds and vocal resonance</b>. Strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a <b>left parasternal heave, loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound or raised jugular veinous pressure</b>. If it is a large hemorrhage or infarction, a low-grade <b>fever</b> may be present.</p>

        <p>To some extent, it is possible to determine the size of the embolus and thus the region of infarction based on the symptomatology. </p>

        <h4>Smaller emboli</h4>
        <p>They tend to lodge in the more <b>peripheral areas</b> without collateral circulation, which then carries a higher risk for infarction. This then causes significant pain, but not necessarily hypoxia, dyspnea and/or haemodynamic instability.</p>

        <h4>Larger emboli</h4>
        <p>They tend to lodge <b>centrally</b> which does <b>not cause infarction</b> as there is collateral circulation. Because of this, they're often painless. However, they typically do cause <b>dyspnea, hypoxia, low blood pressure, tachycardia, and fainting</b>. </p>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

        <p>The preferred method of diagnosis is a <b>CT pulmonary angiogram</b> because it's easy and accurate. One could also use probability testing, which is usally done by the <b>Wells score</b>:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Clinically suspect DVT -> 3 points</li>
            <li>Alternative diagnosis less likely -> 3 points</li>
            <li>Tachycardia -> 1.5 points</li>
            <li>Immobilisation or surgery in last month -> 1.5 points</li>
            <li>History of DVT or PE -> 1.5 points</li>
            <li>Hemoptysis -> 1 point</li>
            <li>Malignancy -> 1 point</li>

        </ol>

        <p>This is then interpreted using the cutoff of <b>4</b>: above 4 PE is likely and one should use <b>diagnostic imaging</b> while below it, one can rely on the D-dimer rule.</p>

        <p>D-dimer then, a <b>fibrin degredation product</b>, is <b>highly sensitive but not specific (~50%)</b> which means that it may be used to exclude PE when negative but not diagnose PE when positive. <b>Troponin</b> also is increased up to <b>50%</b> in PE.</p>

        <p>Alternative imagine includes a <b>ventilation/perfusion scan</b> or lung scintigraphy, which is used in those allergic to iodinated contrasted or when pregnant. Chest X-rays are often done on those with dyspnea and are useful for <b>CHF or rib fractures</b> but often don't show sufficient signs to diagnose PE. Ultrasonography may be useful to indicated anticoagulants, especially in the pregnant.</p>

        <p>An ECG is useful to exclude other origins, and may show right heart straight or acute cor pulmonale in case of large PE (<b>large S wave in lead I, large Q in III, and inverted T in lead III</b>). Any case then, with an inverted T in <b>V1-3</b> is <b>suspected of PE or inferior MI</b>.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>

        <p>The basis of treatment of PE is <b>anticoagulant therapy</b> with supportive treatments such as oxygen or analgesia. The main anticoagulant used to be <b>vitamin K antagonists</b> (Warfarin etc.), however as they act very slowly, current treatment is started by injecting <b>heparin or LMWH</b>. Even <b>DOACs</b> are now used as replacement of Vitamin K antagonists as those don't require titration to the INR. Therapy is usally continued for <b>3-6 months</b> or lifelong if there is previous DVTs or PEs or if there is non-transient risk factors.</p>
        <p>If the PE causes <b>haemodynamic instability</b>, i.e., systolic pressure under 90 or a drop of 40 mmHG for more than 15 minutes, then <b>thrombolysis should be employed</b>. This entails the <b>enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication</b>. One could, however, also use a <b>catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)</b> performed by an interventional radiologist.</p>
        <p>If anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated or ineffective, an <b>inferior vena cava filter</b> could be amployed. </p>

        <h2>Prognosis</h2>
        <p>Fatality rate is low: <b>less than 5-10%</b> percent of symptomatic PE lead to death within the hour.</p>
