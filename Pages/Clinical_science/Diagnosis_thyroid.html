    <!-- INTRODUCTION TO THE THYROID -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Introduction to the Thyroid Gland</h1>
        <p>The <b>thyroid gland</b> is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the <b>anterior neck</b>, inferior to the larynx and overlying the trachea. It plays a crucial role in <b>metabolic regulation</b> through the production of thyroid hormones: <b>thyroxine (T4)</b> and <b>triiodothyronine (T3)</b>.</p>
        <p>These hormones influence nearly every tissue in the body, regulating basal metabolic rate, heat production, and affecting cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. The thyroid is under control of the <b>hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis</b>.</p>
        <p>The history of thyroid disease treatment spans from crude surgical approaches in antiquity to the fine-tuned biochemical and radiological diagnostics and treatments we use today.</p>

    <!-- HYPOTHYROIDISM -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Understanding Hypothyroidism</h1>
        <p><b>Hypothyroidism</b> refers to the clinical state resulting from insufficient thyroid hormone production. Symptoms include <b>fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation</b>, and <b>bradycardia</b>. In severe cases, it leads to <b>myxedema</b>, a life-threatening form of hypothyroidism.</p>
        <p>Thyroid hormone deficiency reduces cellular metabolism, leading to systemic slowing down of physiological processes. Understanding this helps interpret lab tests (e.g., <b>elevated TSH with low free T4</b>) and guides replacement therapy.</p>

    <!-- COMMON CAUSES OF HYPOTHYROIDISM -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Common Causes of Hypothyroidism</h1>
        <h2>1. Hashimoto's Thyroiditis</h2>
        <p>An autoimmune disease where <b>anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO)</b> and <b>anti-thyroglobulin antibodies</b> attack thyroid tissue, leading to fibrosis and atrophy. It presents with painless goiter and typical hypothyroid symptoms. Diagnosed with positive antibodies and ultrasound, treated with <b>levothyroxine</b>.</p>
        <h2>2. Post-ablative Hypothyroidism</h2>
        <p>Occurs after radioactive iodine therapy or thyroidectomy, typically in the context of Graves' disease or thyroid cancer. Requires lifelong hormone replacement.</p>
        <h2>3. Iodine Deficiency</h2>
        <p>Still prevalent in certain regions, leading to goiter formation and hypothyroidism. Diagnosed by history and urinary iodine levels. Managed with dietary iodine or supplementation.</p>
        <h2>4. Congenital Hypothyroidism</h2>
        <p>Due to thyroid dysgenesis or dyshormonogenesis. Critical to diagnose early via newborn screening to prevent <b>cretinism</b>.</p>
        <h2>5. Secondary Hypothyroidism</h2>
        <p>Due to pituitary or hypothalamic failure (low TSH with low T4). Often accompanied by other pituitary hormone deficiencies.</p>

    <!-- HYPERTHYROIDISM INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Introduction to Hyperthyroidism</h1>
        <p><b>Hyperthyroidism</b> refers to the clinical state resulting from elevated levels of circulating thyroid hormones. It leads to a <b>hypermetabolic state</b> characterized by symptoms such as <b>weight loss</b>, <b>heat intolerance</b>, <b>tremors</b>, <b>palpitations</b>, and <b>anxiety</b>. Reflexes are brisk, and there may be proximal muscle weakness.</p>
        <p>The physiological basis lies in the overactivation of cellular metabolism via increased mitochondrial activity, Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase activity, and enhanced catecholamine sensitivity.</p>

    <!-- 5 COMMON CAUSES OF HYPERTHYROIDISM -->

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>1. Graves' Disease</h2>
        <p>This is an <b>autoimmune disorder</b> where thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) bind to the TSH receptor, causing autonomous thyroid hormone production. It's the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in young adults and is associated with <b>ophthalmopathy</b> and <b>pretibial myxedema</b>.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis is confirmed by low TSH, high T4/T3, and positive TSI. Radioactive iodine uptake is diffusely elevated. Treatment includes antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or surgery.</p>
        <div class="mnemonic">
            <p><b>Mnemonic:</b> Think "GRAVES = Glaring eyes, Raised metabolism, Autoimmune, Very high uptake, Exophthalmos, Stimulatory antibodies"</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>2. Toxic Multinodular Goiter</h2>
        <p>This condition involves multiple <b>autonomously functioning thyroid nodules</b> producing thyroid hormones independent of TSH regulation. It generally affects older adults and lacks ophthalmopathy.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis includes heterogeneous uptake on radioactive scan. Treatment includes antithyroid medication and, if needed, surgery or ablation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 7</h1>
        <p>What distinguishes toxic multinodular goiter from Graves' disease?</p>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>3. Toxic Adenoma</h2>
        <p>A single autonomously functioning nodule that secretes thyroid hormone, often seen in younger patients. Diagnosed by a "hot nodule" on scan, with suppressed uptake in surrounding tissue.</p>
        <p>Treated by radioactive iodine or surgical excision.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>4. Subacute (De Quervain) Thyroiditis</h2>
        <p>This post-viral thyroiditis causes transient hyperthyroidism due to <b>inflammatory destruction</b> of follicular cells. It presents with <b>painful thyroid</b> and raised ESR. Thyroid function typically normalizes after a brief hypothyroid phase.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>5. Factitious Thyrotoxicosis</h2>
        <p>This results from intentional or accidental ingestion of thyroid hormone. There is low TSH, high T4, but low thyroglobulin. There is no uptake on scan, distinguishing it from endogenous causes.</p>

    <!-- HYPER/HYPOPARATHYROIDISM -->

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Parathyroid Dysfunction</h1>
        <p>The <b>parathyroid glands</b> regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis via <b>parathyroid hormone (PTH)</b>. PTH increases serum calcium through bone resorption, renal reabsorption, and increased vitamin D activation.</p>
        <p><b>Hyperparathyroidism</b> typically results in hypercalcemia, "bones, stones, groans, and psychiatric overtones." Causes include adenoma, hyperplasia, or carcinoma. </p>
        <p><b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> leads to hypocalcemia with tetany, Chvostek and Trousseau signs. It can follow thyroidectomy or be autoimmune.</p>
