        <h1>Introduction, History and Epidemiology</h1>

        <p>
            Neuropathic pain is a complex and often chronic condition resulting from a <b>lesion or disease of the
                somatosensory system</b>, whether peripheral or central. It poses a significant clinical challenge as
            current conventional medications, such as pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants,
            provide substantial relief to less than 50% of patients.
            <br><br>
            Neuropathic pain encompasses a broad category of pain syndromes originating from a wide variety of
            peripheral or central disorders. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines it as
            pain directly caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, a definition that replaced
            older ones to more precisely delineate its characteristics and mechanisms. The term also distinguishes it
            from other types of pain, such as nociceptive pain, which arises from actual or threatened damage to
            non-neural tissue. Historically, pain following nervous system injury has been recognised under various
            names, including nerve injury pain, neuralgia, deafferentation pain, neurogenic pain, and central pain.
            Early descriptions of heightened sensibility and conditions like causalgia were provided by Silas Weir
            Mitchell in 1872. The concepts of epicritic and protopathic sensitivity were introduced by Henry Head and
            Rivers in 1908, with Melzack and Wall later developing the influential gate control theory.
            <br><br>
            The overall prevalence of neuropathic pain in the general population is reported to be between <b>7% and
                10%</b>, accounting for 20–25% of individuals experiencing chronic pain. Central neuropathic pain (CNP),
            which stems from a lesion or disease of the central somatosensory nervous system, includes conditions such
            as central post-stroke pain (CPSP), pain after spinal cord injury (SCI), and pain associated with multiple
            sclerosis (MS). CPSP is the <b>most prevalent form of CNP worldwide</b>, affecting an estimated 11% of
            stroke patients, and up to 50% in cases of medullary, thalamic, and operculo-insular strokes. For
            individuals with SCI, neuropathic pain has a pooled prevalence of about 53%, predominantly CNP. In MS
            patients, neuropathic extremity pain, Lhermitte sign, and trigeminal neuralgia have prevalence estimates of
            26%, 16%, and 3.8% respectively. Data on CNP after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are currently limited.

        <h1>Aetiology and Pathophysiology</h1>

        <p>
            Neuropathic pain's pathophysiology is complex and involves <b>ectopic activity in damaged nerve fibres</b>
            and pathways, alongside <b>peripheral and central sensitisation</b>.
            <br> - <b>Ectopic Activity and Hyperexcitability:</b> Damaged peripheral or central nerve pathways,
            including the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), can generate abnormal spontaneous activity and lead to neuronal
            hyperexcitability, a key feature in both peripheral and central neuropathic pain.
            <br> - <b>Sensitisation:</b> This involves maladaptive plasticity within spinal and brain circuits
            associated with nociception and antinociception. A disrupted balance between excitation and inhibition in
            spinal circuits is a significant factor, potentially due to reduced expression of the potassium-chloride
            exporter KCC2, which diminishes inhibition.
            <br> - <b>Glial Involvement:</b> Non-neuronal cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes, play a central
            role. Injured peripheral afferents can release colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), activating microglia,
            which then proliferate and release various pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF, interleukins,
            fractalkine, and chemokines. Astrocytes are subsequently activated, further propagating the
            neuroinflammatory cascade and enhancing neuronal activity.
            <br> - <b>Mitochondrial Dysfunction:</b> This is a common underlying factor, observed in human conditions
            and animal models of diverse neuropathic pain types. It can result from direct nerve injury, chemotherapy,
            anti-HIV treatments, or high glucose levels in diabetic neuropathy, leading to energy deficits and cellular
            degeneration. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is closely linked to this dysfunction, and
            stabilising hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1α) has shown promise in suppressing ROS production.
            <br><br>
            <b>Aetiologies</b> of neuropathic pain are diverse:
            <br> - <b>Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</b> is often caused by painful peripheral neuropathies due to
            metabolic conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, alcohol), inflammatory conditions (e.g., post-herpetic
            neuralgia), or traumatic nerve injury. Other causes include Fabry disease, sodium channel gene mutations,
            autoimmune diseases, vasculitis, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and paraneoplastic syndromes.
            <br> - <b>Central Neuropathic Pain</b> can occur after a stroke, spinal cord injury, or in patients with
            multiple sclerosis or syringomyelia. Brain injury and neuroinflammatory conditions are also identified
            causes.
            <br> - <b>Specific Conditions:</b>
            <br> - -> <b>Trigeminal Neuralgia</b> typically involves unilateral, short, severe pain attacks in the face.
            It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (trigeminal neuropathy), often linked to a lesion or compression
            of the trigeminal nerve, sometimes due to postherpetic neuralgia or MS.
            <br> - -> <b>Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDNP)</b> is a common complication of diabetes mellitus.
            <br> - -> <b>Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)</b> results from Herpes Zoster virus reactivation, causing
            inflammation and necrosis in the affected ganglion and nerve root, leading to persistent pain,
            hyperaesthesia, and allodynia in the dermatomal area.
            <br> - -> <b>Polyneuropathy</b> refers to a usually symmetrical disorder of peripheral nerves, affecting
            multiple nerves, often distally first. Common causes include diabetes mellitus, HIV, and chemotherapy,
            though many cases are idiopathic.
            <br><br>
            Mixed pain syndromes, like lumbar or cervical radiculopathies, involve both neuropathic and non-neuropathic
            mechanisms.

        <h1>Diagnosis</h1>

        <p>
            Diagnosing neuropathic pain is challenging due to the lack of a <b>gold standard</b> or specific biomarkers.
            Instead, a <b>hierarchical grading system</b> is used to determine the certainty of diagnosis, classifying
            it into possible, probable, and definite neuropathic pain.
            <br> - <b>Possible Neuropathic Pain</b> relies on a patient's history indicating a relevant lesion or
            disease of the somatosensory nervous system, with pain distribution being neuroanatomically plausible.
            <br> - <b>Probable Neuropathic Pain</b> adds a physical examination revealing sensory signs, such as
            deficits in mechanical or thermal perception, or hypersensitivity like allodynia, in a neuroanatomically
            plausible area. This level is typically sufficient for initiating specific treatment.
            <br> - <b>Definite Neuropathic Pain</b> requires confirmatory tests to verify the central somatosensory
            nervous system lesion or disease that explains the pain's spatial distribution, while ruling out other
            potential causes.
            <br><br>
            Clinical examination may reveal allodynia (pain from a normally non-painful stimulus), hyperalgesia
            (increased pain from a normally painful stimulus), or sensory loss. Patients often describe spontaneous pain
            as burning, shooting, pricking, pins and needles, squeezing, or freezing, sometimes with intermittent
            electric-shock-like paroxysms. Non-painful sensations like dysaesthesia (unpleasant abnormal sensation) and
            paraesthesia (non-unpleasant abnormal sensation) can also occur. Challenges in diagnosis include the dynamic
            nature of the nociceptive system and the subjective nature of symptoms. While sensory profiles have been
            identified, they may reflect neuropathy itself rather than specific pain mechanisms.

        <h1>Treatment (Current and New Developments)</h1>

        <p>
            The management of neuropathic pain is primarily <b>symptomatic</b>, focusing on pain relief and improving
            quality of life, rather than treating the underlying cause. A <b>multimodal approach</b> is recommended,
            prioritising self-management strategies and patient education. Addressing underlying somatic causes like
            suboptimal glycaemic control or nutritional deficiencies is also advised. Pharmacotherapy has a modest role
            due to varied responses and common side effects.
            <br><br>
            <b>Current Pharmacological Treatments (First-line):</b>
            <br> - <b>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):</b> Such as amitriptyline (or nortriptyline for older patients),
            are strongly recommended and are often a first-line choice for polyneuropathy. They likely modulate
            descending pain control systems by inhibiting serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake, and have effects on
            sodium channels and opioid receptors.
            <br> - <b>Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):</b> Including duloxetine (and venlafaxine,
            often off-label), are also strongly recommended, with duloxetine preferred for painful diabetic neuropathy.
            Their mechanism is similar to TCAs, modulating descending pain pathways.
            <br> - <b>Gabapentinoids:</b> Gabapentin and pregabalin are strongly recommended. Pregabalin can be a
            first-line choice for patients with anxiety, while gabapentin is preferred for severe spasticity. They work
            by attenuating neuronal hyperexcitability via presynaptic calcium channels. Regulatory bodies recommend
            monitoring for misuse or abuse, and caution against co-administration with CNS depressants due to
            respiratory depression risk.
            <br> - <b>Carbamazepine/Oxcarbazepine:</b> These are <b>first-line treatments for trigeminal neuralgia</b>.
            Carbamazepine, however, has notable side effects, including severe skin reactions, and interacts with other
            medications due to liver enzyme induction.
            <br><br>
            <b>Other Pharmacological Options:</b>
            <br> - <b>Topical Agents:</b> Capsaicin 8% patches are weakly recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain,
            but not for trigeminal neuralgia due to eye risk. Lidocaine patches are used for postherpetic neuralgia.
            <br> - <b>Botulinum Toxin Type A:</b> Weakly recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain, and while some
            evidence suggests benefit in diabetic neuropathy, it's not a standard recommendation in Dutch guidelines.
            <br> - <b>Tramadol and Opioids:</b> Some evidence of effect, but generally not recommended for chronic
            non-cancer pain.
            <br> - <b>Sodium Channel Blockers:</b> While evidence is inconclusive for general use, some, like
            carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, are specifically effective in subgroups such as trigeminal neuralgia
            patients.
            <br><br>
            <b>Combination Therapy:</b> When monotherapy is insufficient, combining two agents with different mechanisms
            (e.g., an antidepressant and an anti-epileptic) is often considered, typically under specialist care.
            <br><br>
            <b>Cannabis-based Medicines (CbMs) and Medical Cannabis (MC):</b>
            <br> - These are considered potential treatment options for chronic neuropathic pain. They are available in
            various forms, including licensed medications, magistral preparations like dronabinol, and herbal cannabis
            with defined content of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or cannabidiol (CBD).
            <br> - Systematic reviews present <b>low-quality evidence</b> and <b>divergent conclusions</b> regarding
            their efficacy, ranging from "not effective" to "clinically meaningful benefit".
            <br> - Clinically relevant side effects, particularly central nervous system and psychiatric disorders, have
            been reported.
            <br> - Recommendations from medical associations vary widely, from negative to third-line treatment. Some
            acknowledge their common use in practice, justifying a third-line recommendation.
            <br> - There's a recognised <b>lack of robust evidence for efficacy and safety</b>, with concerns about
            long-term adverse effects based on recreational use. The evidence is also noted to be biased due to industry
            sponsorship and patient populations (cannabis-naïve vs. recreational users).
            <br> - No single CbM or MC preparation is favoured by current evidence.
            <br> - Guidance for clinical use includes a comprehensive clinical evaluation, integration into multimodal
            treatment plans, shared decision-making, careful dose adjustment, and long-term monitoring of effectiveness
            and adverse events. There remains <b>much uncertainty</b> about their true place as a therapeutic option,
            underscoring the need for more rigorous research.
            <br><br>
            <b>New Developments and Challenges:</b>
            <br> - Despite decades of research, surprisingly few novel, effective, and safe treatments have been
            introduced, and most have arisen from empirical observation rather than targeted translational approaches.
            <br> - Future directions include investigating neuroinflammation using advanced imaging (diffusion-weighted
            MRI, PET) and developing neuromodulation therapies to address aberrant neural states.
            <br> - The field of precision medicine in pain is developing but faces challenges due to insufficient
            biological understanding of drug mechanisms and pain phenotypes.

        <h1>Prognosis</h1>

        <p>Neuropathic pain remains a <b>difficult-to-treat condition</b>, representing a significant unmet medical
            need. The response to pharmacological treatments is often modest, and many patients do not achieve
            sufficient pain relief at tolerable doses. Side effects are also common, impacting the overall benefit. For
            conditions like postherpetic neuralgia, pain can be persistent, lasting for months or even returning after
            pain-free periods. The long-term safety and efficacy of emerging treatments, particularly cannabis-based
            medicines, still require more robust real-world data and rigorous research to ascertain their true place and
            potential for abuse or dependence. Ultimately, a clearer understanding of potential benefits versus harms
            requires continued and thorough scientific investigation.</p>
