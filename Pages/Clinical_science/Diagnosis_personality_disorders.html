        <h1>Introduction to Personality Disorders</h1>
        
        <p><b>Personality disorders</b> represent enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from the expectations of an individual's culture, are pervasive and inflexible, have an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, are stable over time, and lead to distress or impairment. These disorders are classified into three clusters (A, B, and C) based on descriptive similarities.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The concept of personality disorders has evolved significantly since the late 19th century. Early descriptions by <b>Philippe Pinel</b> (1801) of "mania without delirium" and <b>J.C. Prichard's</b> (1835) "moral insanity" laid groundwork for understanding these conditions. The modern conceptualization emerged through <b>psychoanalytic theories</b> (Freud, Jung), <b>behavioral models</b>, and eventually the <b>DSM system</b>, which operationalized diagnostic criteria.</p>
        
        <h2>Neurobiological Underpinnings</h2>
        <p>Current research suggests personality disorders arise from complex interactions between:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Genetic factors</b>: Heritability estimates range from 30-60% for various traits</li>
            <li><b>Neuroanatomical differences</b>: Particularly in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and anterior cingulate</li>
            <li><b>Neurochemical factors</b>: Dysregulation in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems</li>
            <li><b>Temperamental predispositions</b>: Observable from early childhood</li>
            <li><b>Environmental influences</b>: Especially childhood trauma and attachment disruptions</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The <b>diathesis-stress model</b> best explains how these factors interact - innate vulnerabilities are activated or exacerbated by environmental stressors during critical developmental periods.</p>
        
        <h2>Diagnostic Approach</h2>
        <p>Diagnosis requires:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Assessment of <b>long-term patterns</b> (not episodic symptoms)</li>
            <li>Evaluation across <b>multiple domains</b>: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, impulse control</li>
            <li>Determination that patterns are <b>inflexible and maladaptive</b></li>
            <li>Exclusion of substance-induced or medical etiology</li>
        </ol>
