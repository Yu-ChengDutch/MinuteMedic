        <h1>Electrolyte imbalances</h1>
        <p>All electrodes play significant roles in homeostasis throughout the body. There are two ways elektrolyte imbalances may come to be:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Consuming too little / too much electrolytes</li>
            <li>Excreting too little / too much electrolytes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The importance of elektrodes is based on their role in the maintenance of voltages across cell membranes. It is hence good to know that all electrolytes implicated in disorders are <b>cations (+)</b> except for <b>chloride and phosphate</b>, which are <b>anions (-)</b>.</p>
        <p>Increased loss may occur through a GI-route (diarrhea, laxatives, vomiting), a urinary route (kidney disorders) or a transdermal route (sweat). The latter mostly excretes <b>potassium and sodium</b>.</p>

        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <p>Which two elektrolytes are anions (-)?</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">

        <h1>Sodium</h1>
        <p>The most common type of electrolyte imbalance is <b>hyponatraemia</b> which thus deserves a more in-depth treatment. There are three types of hyponatraemia, with associated aetiologies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia: Thiazide diuretic-use</li>
            <li>Euvolaemic hyponatraemia: SIADH <b>or</b> ACTH-deficiency</li>
            <li>Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia: CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Important is that the <b>osmolality</b> in these disorders is all decreased, which is what is expected in hyponatraemia. However, there exists also <b>non-hypotonic hyponatraemia</b> which is usually caused by <b>hyperglycaemia</b> which causes water to shift from the intra- to the extracellular fluid, diluting sodium.</p>

        <h2>Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia</h2>
        <p>Most commonly presenting in the elderly, further risk factors include <b>low BMI, hypokalaemia and female gender</b>. Examples of thiazide diurects include <b>hydrochlorothizide, chlorthalidone and indapamide</b>. They inhibit the reabsorption of sodium in the <b>distal convoluted tubule of the nephron</b>. Hence they <b>stimulate natiuresis</b>.</p>

        <h2>SIADH</h2>
        <p>"Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis" is a common complication of a wide variety of disorders and treatments, the most common of which are <b>malignancy, pulmonary disorders, CNS disorders and medication</b>. It has five essential diagnostic criteria:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Plasma hypoosmolality</li>
            <li>Urine hyperconcentration</li>
            <li>Urinary hypernatraemia</li>
            <li>Clinical euvolaemia (i.e., no edema etc.)</li>
            <li>Exclusion of ACTH-deficiency or hypothyroidism</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Congestive Heart Failure</h2>
        <p>Similar to <b>liver cirrhosis</b>, in case of CHF the mean arterial pressure falls which <b>increases baroregulated vasopressin secretion</b>, which in turns actives the RAAS-axis and leads to <b>water retention</b>.</p>

        <p>The opposite, namely <b>hyper</b>natraemia, is not common in healthy people and is usually due to dehydration.</p>

        <h1>Symptomatology</h1>
        <p>Mild symptoms are shared between the two and involve the <b>GI-system</b>, namely: <b>nausea, vomiting, fatigue and weakness</b>. Hyponatraemia may present with more severe symptoms often involving the <b>CNS</b>, namely: <b>seizures, coma and brain herniation (fatal)</b>.</p>

        <h1>Chloride</h1>
        <p>After sodium, chloride is the most common electrolyte in the body; with most of it entering the body together in the form of normal salt. It plays an important role in acids throughout the body, such as <b>gastric acid (HCl)</b> and is hence often inverse with <b>bicarbonate</b> which determines acid-base status.</p>

        <h2>Hyperchloraemia</h2>
        <p>Usually associated with excess intake (e.g., saltwater drowning) or fluid loss, it might also characteristically be caused by <b>metabolic acidosis</b>! However, patients often remain <b>asymptomatic</b>.</p>

        <h2>Hypochloraemia</h2>
        <p>Usually associated with excess loss (e.g., vomiting). Rarely, it is associated with <b>chronic respiratory acidosis</b>.</p>

    <div class="explanation-card">

        <h1>Magnesium</h1>
        <p>More than 90% of magnesium is stored intracellularly, with the vast majority being located in the bones. <b>Hypermagnesaemia</b> is largely only seen in magnesium-containing medication such as <b>aripriprazole, methylphenidate and magnesium(hydr)oxide (e.g., antagel)</b>. Typically, it may cause <b>decreased deep tendon reflexes</b> and in severe cases <b>respiratory failure, bradycardia and paralysis</b>.</p>

        <h1>Potassium</h1>
        <p>Residing mainly intracellularly, potassium has a relatively low concentration in the blood stream.</p>

        <h2>Hyperkalaemia</h2>
        <p>Besides true hyperkalaemia, a type of faux-hyperkaelemia named <b>haemolytic hyperkalaemia</b> is due to breakdown of a sample. True hyperkalaemia however, is almost always caused by a <b>renal</b> problem. In terms of symptomatology, it is considered to the be the <b>most dangerous</b> elektrolyte disorder, as severe hyperkalaemia is associated with <b>muscle cramps, numbness, tingling, absence of reflexes, paralysis and notably <u>arrhythmias</u></b>. Treatment is achieved using the stabilisation of cardiac cells <b>(calcium perfusion)</b>, shift of potassium intracellularly <b>(insulin perfusion)</b>, or removal of potassium from the body <b>(haemodialysis or <u>loop diuretics</u>)</b>. On an EKG, a mild hyperkalaemia may show as <b>peaked T-waves</b>, while a severe hyperkalaemia causes progressive atrial paralysis <b>(P-wave flattening)</b> and eventually <b>bradyarrthymias</b> resulting in asystole.</p>

        <h2>Hypokalaemia</h2>
        <p>This is the <b>most common electrolyte disorder</b> and often occurs concurrently with <b>hypomagnesemia</b>. Both various forms of <b>acidosis</b>, as well as <b>hyperaldosteronism</b> are common culprits. Similar to hyperkalaemia, common mild symptoms are <b>cramping and fatigue</b>, while severe symptoms include arrhythmias with on the EKG <b>ST-depression</b> with eventual <b>T-wave <u>inversion</u></b>.</p>
