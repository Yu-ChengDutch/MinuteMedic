    <h1>Etiology and Pathophysiology</h1>
    <p>
        The origin of sleep disorders in the presence of CNS pathology is often complex and multifactorial. In some cases, the CNS pathology itself can be the primary cause of sleep dysfunction. Alternatively, secondary factors like weight gain, depression, anxiety, pain, and medications can cause or worsen an existing sleep disorder.
        <br><br>
        It is challenging to differentiate the patho-anatomy of the sleep disorder from the underlying CNS pathology. For instance, while OSA is often linked to anatomical issues and obesity, there's evidence suggesting a CNS contribution to its high prevalence in individuals with CNS pathology. Functional neuroimaging studies in OSA patients have identified frequent involvement of the ascending reticular activating system, prefrontal cortices, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and parietal cortices in cognitive and neuropsychological impairments.
        <br><br>
        Specific examples of pathophysiological links include:
        <br>   <b>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):</b> Damage to the brain and adjacent structures can directly lead to sleep disorders, such as abnormal CNS levels of orexin or hypocretin associated with Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders (CRSD).
        <br>   <b>Stroke:</b> Sleep-wake disorders following stroke have been linked to bilateral paramedian thalamic, mesencephalic, and brainstem infarcts, as well as large hemispheric strokes. Ponto-mesencephalic stroke can lead to a near-complete loss of sleep, and thalamic stroke can result in a lack of brain waves. Insomnia after stroke may be directly associated with brain injury, with different stroke locations affecting REM or NREM sleep.
        <br>   <b>Spinal Cord Injury (SCI):</b> Weight gain and changes in breathing during sleep show some correlation, with a strong link between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and changes in abdominal girth.
        <br>   <b>Parkinson's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia:</b> Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is common in Parkinson's disease and has been associated with pathology of the dorsal mesopontine tegmentum, supporting the theory that RBD may be part of a continuum of neurodegenerative diseases. There is a decrease in presynaptic dopamine transporters in the striatum in this population.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Epidemiology and Disease Progression</h1>
    <p>
        Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in CNS conditions:
        <br>   <b>TBI:</b> Sleep disorders are reported in up to 70% of the population, including OSA, CSA, hypersomnia, periodic limb movement disorder, and CRSD. The severity of TBI does not correlate with the type or severity of the sleep disorder. Sleep disturbances tend to improve over time after TBI, though epidemiological data remains inconsistent.
        <br>   <b>Stroke:</b> Stroke survivors have an increased risk for OSA (50-70% within the first 3 months). Risk factors for OSA like obesity and cardiovascular disease are also risk factors for stroke. CSA is less common after stroke and has a higher probability of recovery over time. CRSD are seen in 20-40% of patients after stroke. Sleep disturbances generally improve over time after stroke, with a significant reduction in central apneas but not obstructive apneas after 3 months. Insomnia is seen in approximately 50% of stroke patients in the first few months.
        <br>   <b>SCI:</b> SDB has been reported in 25-60% of all SCI patients and up to 83% of cervical SCI patients, with cervical injury being a particular risk factor. In SCI, chronological age correlates more with sleep dysfunction than time since injury, with fewer problems in patients aged 65 and older.
        <br>   <b>Other Neurological Disorders:</b> RBD is common in Parkinson's disease. Sleep dysfunction can occur in seizure disorders, especially with frequent nocturnal seizures. Alzheimer's disease patients often have CRSD. Sleep dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases may worsen with disease progression, though high-quality longitudinal studies are lacking.
        <br><br>
        <b>Sleep disorders can also be risk factors for stroke:</b>
        <br>   <b>Insomnia:</b> Short sleep (less than 5-6 hours/night) can predict stroke. Insomniacs have a 54% higher stroke risk, especially among young adults. Chronic stress from sleep loss and neuro-inflammation may play roles.
        <br>   <b>Hypersomnia:</b> Sleeping over 9 hours/night strongly predicts stroke events. Excessive sleep is associated with a higher stroke risk than short sleep. Subcortical white matter hyperintensities are correlated with long sleep. Hypersomnia impedes stroke recovery, leading to more disability.
        <br>   <b>Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders (BSDs):</b> BSDs are severe in acute cerebrovascular diseases and increase vascular events or mortality. OSA is a known risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. CSA is also an independent stroke risk factor and negatively correlates with stroke prognosis.
        <br>   <b>Parasomnias:</b> Probable RBD is associated with a higher risk of developing stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic). RLS can induce insomnia and is often accompanied by periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS). RLS occurs in about 12% of post-stroke patients and is more frequent than PLMS. RLS can predict subcortical stroke.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Associated Conditions and Complications</h1>
    <p>
        Identifying sleep disorders after TBI and stroke is crucial because they can <b>adversely affect quality of life</b>. Patients may experience:
        <br>   Excessive daytime somnolence.
        <br>   Worsening of depression.
        <br>   Exacerbation of cognitive impairment.
        <br>   Limited progress toward independence in rehabilitation.
        <br>   Fatigue, the most commonly reported symptom, can further decline cognitive abilities and significantly impact functional status, exacerbating nearly any neurological impairment. It can disrupt balance and coordination, aggravate neurobehavioral symptoms (irritability, agitation), and impair mobility and self-care.
        <br><br>
        <b>Poor sleep, particularly OSA, can increase the risk for hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and stroke</b>. Untreated OSA in stroke patients is correlated with:
        <br>   Lower Barthel scores at 3 and 12 months.
        <br>   Lower rates of discharge to home from inpatient rehabilitation.
        <br>   Higher mortality at 1 year.
        <br>   Increased risk of death in a 10-year follow-up study.
        <br>   Recurrent ischemic stroke, though not mortality, in another large study.
        <br>   Worse outcomes after stroke, including mood depression, delirium, and impairment in reaction and activities of daily living (ADL) abilities.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Essentials of Assessment</h1>
    <p>
        A thorough assessment of sleep dysfunction involves multiple components:
        <br>   <b>History:</b> Clinicians should ask for detailed information about waking and sleeping times, distinguishing between sleep initiation and maintenance difficulties. Observed snoring or witnessed apnea by family members is important. A review of all medications, over-the-counter remedies, supplements, recreational drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and theobromine is necessary. Sleep hygiene patterns and nonpharmacological measures should be discussed. Patients should be asked about feeling rested, daytime fatigue, naps, and morning headaches (possibly linked to OSA). Comorbid conditions like pain and mood disturbances should be identified. Other symptoms like acting out dreams, vocalizations, screaming, or injurious activities at night may indicate RBD or dementia. If seizures are suspected, convulsions, muscle aches upon waking, and incontinence should be discussed.
        <br>   <b>Physical Examination:</b> Inspection of the neck and oropharynx is important if OSA is suspected. Assessment of the visual system, including light/dark detection, can be helpful for potential CRSD patients with vision deficits.
        <br>   <b>Functional Assessment:</b> Assess for fatigue and its impact on cognitive abilities, balance, coordination, neurobehavioral symptoms, mobility, and self-care tasks.
        <br>   <b>Laboratory Studies:</b> Include complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and iron studies (particularly ferritin for restless leg syndrome).
        <br>   <b>Imaging:</b> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can help rule out progression of neurological pathology.
        <br>   <b>Supplemental Assessment Tools:</b>
            <br>  -    <b>Polysomnography (PSG):</b> The standard tool for suspected sleep disorders, identifying OSA, CSA, restless leg syndrome, and RBD, and examining sleep architecture and efficiency.
            <br>  -    <b>Electroencephalography (EEG):</b> Used to evaluate seizure activity, as nocturnal seizures can disrupt sleep and cause daytime sleepiness. Frontal lobe epilepsy can be confused with RBD.
            <br>  -    <b>Actigraphy:</b> May help identify CRSD or poor sleep hygiene.
            <br>  -    <b>Validated Sleep Questionnaires:</b> Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index can quantify sleep disturbance but don't diagnose disorders. STOPBANG and MAPI can be effective in diagnosing sleep apnea when properly risk-stratified.
        <br>   <b>Early Predictions of Outcomes:</b> Involve assessing injury severity, comorbidities, age, pre-injury sleep patterns, neurological functioning, social support, environmental factors, treatment compliance, and timing of interventions. Clinical resolution of sleep dysfunction positively predicts improvement in daytime fatigue, cognition, and somatic symptoms in non-neurologically impaired populations.
        <br>   <b>Environmental Factors:</b> Noise, lighting, temperature, bedroom conditions, daily routines, and social support significantly impact sleep. Optimizing the sleep environment, establishing consistent routines, reducing noise and light, regulating temperature, and promoting relaxation techniques are important.
        <br>   <b>Social Role and Social Support System:</b> Sleep disorders can lead to marital stress, separate sleeping arrangements, and loss of intimacy. They can also impact work performance and overall quality of life, often requiring psychological or therapeutic intervention.

<div class="explanation-card">
    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>Initial Intervention:</b> Education on appropriate sleep hygiene.
        <br>   <b>Pharmacologic Treatment (if insufficient):</b>
            <br>  -    <b>Melatonin and ramelteon:</b> Especially if CRSD is present.
            <br>  -    <b>Soporific medications:</b> Zolpidem tartrate, eszopiclone, zaleplon (use cautiously). Zolpidem might improve stroke prognosis at low doses but can increase stroke risk at higher doses.
            <br>  -    <b>Antidepressants:</b> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g., mianserin, trazodone), particularly if insomnia is linked to mood or anxiety disorders. SSRIs can decrease REM sleep and increase daytime fatigue.
            <br>  -    <b>Atypical antipsychotics:</b> Quetiapine, ziprasidone, risperidone (conservative use, helpful with agitation/psychosis).
            <br>  -    <b>Benzodiazepines:</b> Generally <b>not recommended</b> due to potential to aggravate breathing-related sleep disorders, induce motor deficit reappearance, and increase risk of falls and impulse control disorders.
        <br>   <b>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</b> Effective for chronic insomnia in both non-injured and TBI populations, showing sustained gains even after therapy. It reduces dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</h2>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>Standard Treatment:</b> <b>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)</b>. Most studies suggest beneficial effects, particularly in sleepiness, depression, functional recovery, and recurrent events. CPAP is acceptable after stroke and strengthens advantageous positions for brain recovery.
        <br>   <b>Additional Measures:</b> Oral appliances and weight loss. Weight loss can reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).
        <br>   <b>Surgical Treatment:</b> Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (effective but with complications like velopharyngeal insufficiency). Other surgical methods include hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS), upper airway surgery, nasal reconstruction, and mandibular advancement.
        <br>   <b>Avoidance:</b> Benzodiazepines and opioids.
        <br>   <b>Compliance:</b> Less than half of patients tolerate CPAP, though severe swallowing disorders, depression, and dementia can increase compliance. Expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) shows better compliance but not superior treatment effects.
        <br>   <b>Positional Therapy:</b> Using a therapeutic pillow can reduce OSA severity after ischemia and improve outcomes.
        <br>   <b>Lifestyle Changes:</b> Physical activity and dieting are first-line treatments. Keeping sleep records is also recommended.
        <br>   <b>Secondary Complications:</b> Prevention and treatment of pain and respiratory infections.
        <br>   <b>Emerging Interventions:</b> Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of upper airway muscles can improve airflow dynamics without arousal.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)</h2>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>Treatment of Choice:</b> CPAP and bilevel positive airway pressure (effective in only 50% of patients in one study).
        <br>   <b>Other Options:</b> Transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, theophylline anhydrous, and acetazolamide (mixed results).
        <br>   <b>Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV):</b> Considered helpful for normocapnic CSA, especially when CPAP/BiPAP are ineffective. Mechanical ventilation may be needed for hypercapnic CSA or hypoventilation.
        <br>   <b>Avoidance:</b> Benzodiazepines and opioids.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders (CRSD)</h2>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>Environmental Modifications:</b> Light therapy (blue light therapy shows promise for brain healing) and chronotherapy.
        <br>   <b>Behavioral Strategies:</b> Avoidance of naps, daytime physical activity, and keeping the room dark at night.
        <br>   <b>Pharmacologic Treatment:</b> Melatonin and soporific medications for night sleep; modafinil, armodafinil, or other stimulants to reduce daytime fatigue.
    </p>
    
    <h2>REM Behavior Disorder (RBD)</h2>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>Management:</b> Injury prevention and prognostic counseling.
        <br>   <b>Pharmacologic Treatment:</b> Clonazepam (0.25-2.0 mg effective), melatonin (decreases violent attacks, improves dream enactment), dopamine agonists, and donepezil. Fluoxetine has also been reported effective.
        <br>   <b>Avoidance:</b> Alcohol, stimulants, SSRIs, and selegiline can worsen RBD.
    </p>

    <h2>Hypersomnia</h2>
    <p>
        <br><b>Hypersomnia</b>, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and fatigue, is a frequent symptom in patients with central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, especially after stroke. Treating post-stroke hypersomnia is challenging, and high-quality randomized clinical trials are currently lacking.
        <br>Current pharmacological interventions primarily aim to promote wakefulness:
        <br>  - <b>Modafinil</b>: Functions as a weak dopamine re-uptake inhibitor to promote wakefulness, shown to reduce fatigue and improve quality of life after stroke.
        <br>  - <b>Methylphenidate</b>: A norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and neurological stimulant, which may lead to slight improvements in ischemic stroke recovery by enhancing wakefulness.
        <br>  - <b>Levodopa</b>: A precursor of dopamine that modulates the sleep-wake state, it may improve neurological recovery partly by enhancing wakefulness.
        <br>  - <b>Antidepressants</b> and other stimulants like armodafinil may also help reduce daytime fatigue.
        <br><br>Other interventions, such as <b>environmental modifications</b> (e.g., naturalistic light), have shown <b>no significant improvement in hypersomnia</b>. Behavioral-neuropsychological therapy and other supporting therapies, including acupuncture, are considered <b>promising but require more conclusive evidence</b>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</h2>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>Pharmacologic Treatment:</b> Levodopa, dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole), and gabapentin. Dopamine agonists are generally more effective than levodopa.
        <br>   <b>Other Treatments:</b> Iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency.
        <br>   <b>Avoidance:</b> Antidepressants and diazepam can have adverse effects on RLS.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Coordination of Care and Patient Education</h1>
    <p>
        <br>   Nursing and therapy schedules may need adjustment to ensure adequate sleep.
        <br>   Patients with mood and anxiety disorders causing insomnia should be referred to psychology.
        <br>   <b>Patient Education on Good Sleep Hygiene:</b> Consistent sleep/wake times (including weekends), avoiding caffeine after noon, avoiding alcohol and nicotine, regular exercise (but not immediately before bed), getting out of bed if unable to sleep for >20 minutes, reserving the bedroom for sleep/intimacy, and taking a hot bath/shower before bed.
        <br>   Education about the medical sequelae of untreated sleep disorders, especially sleep apnea, is vital.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Emerging Interventions and Knowledge Gaps</h1>
    <p>
        <br>   <b>New Assessment Techniques:</b> Thorough and uninterrupted EEG signal examination, new metrics for oxygen levels, and home monitoring for circadian rhythms are emerging. Portable respiratory recordings, actigraphy, and home polysomnography will enhance accurate diagnosis in rehabilitation and home settings.
        <br>   <b>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):</b> Promising for primary insomnia (low-frequency rTMS to right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or posterior parietal cortex), RLS (high-frequency and low-frequency rTMS over primary motor cortex or supplementary motor cortex), and OSA (stimulation of upper airway muscles). Its effect on sleep disorders secondary to brain injury needs further exploration.
    </p>
    
    <h1><b>Gaps in Evidence-Based Knowledge:</b></h1>
    <p>
        <br>   Incomplete understanding of specific prevalence and incidence rates of sleep disorders in CNS-injured populations.
        <br>   Limited insight into underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology.
        <br>   Lack of high-quality longitudinal studies for neurodegenerative diseases.
        <br>   Limited literature on causal relationships between specific sleep disorders and stroke recovery.
        <br>   Need for more large randomized controlled trials for post-stroke sleep disturbances like hypersomnia, RLS, and RBD.
        <br>   Detailed investigations on the correlations, treatments, and prognosis of sleep disorders and post-stroke depression (PSD) are pressingly needed.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Sleep Disorders and Post-Stroke Depression (PSD)</h1>
    <p>
        Depression is a common mental complication after stroke, often presenting 3-6 months and 2-3 years post-stroke. PSD shares clinical manifestations with traditional depression, including mood dysfunctions (depressive feelings, indifference, irritability) and vegetative signs like <b>sleep disorders</b>. PSD is prevalent (about 30% in stroke survivors) but often underestimated and untreated. PSD predicts mortality and is linked to stroke occurrence and recovery.
        <br><br>
        There is a <b>close interrelation between PSD and poor sleep quality</b>. Neural dysfunction and insomnia are related to PSD, particularly in elderly Chinese patients. In the acute phase of stroke, sleep disorders are common but non-specific indicators of PSD, while fatigue and inappetence might be key predictors. <b>Early treatment of PSD is crucial for improving long-term stroke recovery and sleep disturbances</b>. Antidepressants like SSRIs are recommended for PSD therapy. Other methods such as CBT, electroconvulsive therapy, and psychological treatments are promising but need more evidence.
