        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is <b>the most common form of pediatric scoliosis</b>, affecting
            individuals between the ages of 10 and 18. By definition, "idiopathic" means that the <b>etiology, or cause,
                is unknown</b> and it is not linked to any specific syndromic, congenital, or neuromuscular condition.
            AIS is a complex <b>three-dimensional deformity of the spine and trunk</b>, characterized by frontal curves,
            fixed vertebral rotations, and changes in sagittal physiological curves. It is a structural, lateral,
            rotated curvature that arises in otherwise healthy children around puberty.</p>

        <h1>Epidemiology</h1>
        <p>The prevalence of AIS is estimated to be <b>about 1% to 3%</b>. In the general adolescent population, its
            prevalence ranges from 0.47% to 5.2%. AIS shows a preference for females and a tendency for right-sided
            curvature, being <b>up to ten times more common in female children</b> than in male children. However, boys
            may experience a greater progression of curvature. The primary determinants of progression are the patient's
            sex, future growth potential, and the size of the curve at diagnosis. Growth potential is often estimated
            using the Tanner stage and Risser classification.</p>

        <h1>Diagnosis, Assessment, and Grading</h1>
        <p>
            Diagnosis typically begins with a <b>screening evaluation</b>, often conducted in schools, by sports
            coaches, or by pediatricians. The <b>main diagnostic criterion for scoliosis is a Cobb angle greater than 10
                degrees</b> in the coronal plane.
            <br><br>
            <b>Formal evaluation includes imaging:</b>
            <br> - <b>X-ray imaging</b> is the proper formal evaluation, including standing coronal, sagittal, and left
            and right bending X-rays.
            <br> - The <b>Cobb angle</b>, measured from standing X-rays, is the most commonly used parameter for
            monitoring AIS status and for diagnosing the severity of scoliotic curves.
            <br> - <b>Risser classification</b>, calculated from the iliac crest on the coronal X-ray, provides a useful
            estimate of remaining skeletal growth.
            <br> - <b>CT scans and MRI imaging are generally not warranted for typical AIS patients</b>, though some
            intraoperative imaging guidance techniques may require them, which is surgeon and technology specific.
            <br><br>
            <b>Physical Examination and other assessments:</b>
            <br> - A thorough history and physical examination are essential, with particular attention to developmental
            history to rule out other etiologies.
            <br> - A <b>neurologic assessment</b> is crucial, as well as evaluation of the curve’s shape, form, and
            flexibility.
            <br> - <b>Photographic documentation</b> (standing upright and bending over) is vital for tracking
            progression and operative outcomes.
            <br> - Rib prominence, waistline, and shoulder height should also be documented, as spinal curvature is not
            isolated to a spinal deformity.
            <br> - The <b>angle of trunk rotation (ATR)</b>, measured with a scoliometer, is another parameter for trunk
            deformity assessment and IS monitoring.
            <br> - <b>Quality of life (QoL)</b> is subjectively assessed using standardized questionnaires like SRS-22
            or SRS-23, which cover domains such as function, pain, mental health, self-image, and satisfaction with
            management.
            <br><br>
            <b>Staging:</b>
            <br> - The <b>Lenke Classification scheme</b> is the preferred method for spinal deformity surgeons to
            communicate about AIS and best categorizes staging. It creates a uniform approach to naming and describing
            curves and provides preference for operative treatment protocols.
            <br> - The Lenke Classification considers the <b>coronal curve (1-6)</b>, the <b>sagittal deformity (-, N,
                or +)</b>, and the <b>lumbar spine modifier (A, B, C)</b>, creating descriptors such as 3C+ or 1B-.
        </p>

        <h1>Prognosis</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Untreated scoliosis</b> can lead to deformity progression, which may result in back pain, lumbar
            radiculopathy, cosmetic problems, nerve damage, and even cardiac and pulmonary restriction. Curves exceeding
            80 degrees in the coronal plane can cause increased shortness of breath. For patients whose AIS goes
            untreated into adulthood, the <b>rate of progression is approximately 0.5 to 1 degree per year</b> once a
            50-degree coronal angle is reached. Adult curves tend to be stiffer and more rigid, often requiring more
            aggressive and invasive surgical techniques.
            <br><br>
            Long-term studies report a <b>higher rate of arthritis and poor perception of body image</b> in patients
            with scoliosis, regardless of treatment. If surgical correction involves chest wall invasion, it may also
            lead to pain and decreased lung function.
            <br><br>
            <b>Surgical complications</b> are generally lower than in adult spinal deformity surgery but can include:
            neurologic injury (0.9%), respiratory complications (2.8%), cardiac complications (0.8%), infection (0.5%),
            gastrointestinal complications (2.7%), and delayed hardware infections.
            <br><br>
            Despite efforts, the <b>overall outcomes after surgery are often not satisfactory</b>, with serious
            complications that can be worse than the disorder itself. Many patients may also experience low self-esteem
            due to the spinal defect, leading to isolation and withdrawal.

        <h1>Treatment</h1>
        <p>
            Treatment options for AIS include <b>conservative management, bracing, or operative intervention</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>General Treatment Guidelines based on Cobb Angle:</b>
            <br> - Curves <b>less than 10 degrees do not meet the specification for a diagnosis of AIS</b>.
            <br> - Curves of <b>10 to 25 degrees are generally monitored</b> with serial X-rays at 3, 6, or 12-month
            intervals.
            <br> - Curves <b>greater than 25 degrees but less than 40 to 45 degrees are candidates for bracing</b>.
            <br> - Curves <b>over 40 to 45 degrees in skeletally immature individuals are operative candidates</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Bracing:</b>
            <br> - Bracing has traditionally been a mainstay of conservative treatment.
            <br> - The Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BrAIST) demonstrated the <b>effectiveness of
                bracing</b> in the adolescent population.
            <br> - Braces provide a passive and active stimulus for correction and have a growth-restricting effect.
            <br> - Historically, the <b>Milwaukee-brace</b> was the gold standard, followed by the <b>Boston-brace</b>
            and the <b>Charleston-Bending-Brace</b> (designed for nighttime wear). The <b>Jacques Cheneau's Inspirations
                derotation brace</b> also rapidly spread.
            <br> - Despite their effectiveness, braces are often uncomfortable and have <b>low compliance rates</b>,
            with their overall success remaining questionable. Patient and parental education is required for adherence
            to bracing protocols, as compliance is crucial for improved outcomes.
            <br> - Studies suggest that 12 to 16 hours of brace wear per day did not lead to a higher progression rate
            compared to more than 16 hours.
            <br> - The <b>primary correction result in the brace (40-50% correction)</b> is a strong indicator of
            long-term improvement potential and a motivator for compliance.
            <br> - The future of brace therapy may involve digital technologies like <b>AI, mathematical model
                calculations, and 3D printing</b>. The scientific review of treatment results is considered essential
            for the continued acceptance of brace treatment.
            <br><br>
            <b>Physiotherapy:</b>
            <br> - Physiotherapy is considered an <b>"adjunctive" treatment</b> that forms the basis of any conservative
            concept. It aims to keep the spine mobile and thus correctable.
            <br> - The <b>International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT)</b> uses
            the term <b>physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE)</b> for approved schools and methods. PSSE
            differs from nonspecific physiotherapy by focusing on <b>three-dimensional self-correction of posture,
                stabilization of corrected posture, patient education, and integration of corrective positions into
                daily activities</b>.
            <br> - The SOSORT consensus places "3D self-correction" as the most important element.
            <br> - PSSE is typically performed by professionally trained instructors, with exercises customized based on
            scoliosis type and severity.
            <br> - While braces are heavily prescribed, physical therapy is recommended for functional deficits, though
            <b>it has no impact on scoliosis itself; it only improves muscle and joint function</b>.
            <br> - Other treatments like <b>electrical stimulation, nutrition, and spinal manipulation have not been
                found effective</b> in managing scoliosis.
            <br> - High-quality research supporting the effectiveness of PSSE physiotherapy in treating AIS has been
            lacking, but existing evidence indicates it can help stabilize spinal deformity and improve quality of life.
            <br> - The effectiveness of PSSE can be assessed by changes in Cobb angle, ATR, quality of life,
            functionality, disability, pain, and aesthetic improvement.
            <br><br>
            <b>Schroth Method:</b>
            <br> - The Schroth method is a <b>three-dimensional physiotherapy approach</b> developed in Germany by
            Katarina Schroth and further developed by her daughter Christa.
            <br> - It is based on <b>sensorimotor and kinesthetic principles</b> and includes corrective exercises,
            posture self-correction, specific breathing techniques (Schroth rotational angular breathing), education,
            and home exercises. Patients use mirrors to visualize deformities and perform self-correction. Tensile force
            is crucial for postural correction.
            <br> - The five principles of the Schroth method are <b>auto-elongation (detorsion), deflection, derotation,
                rotational breathing, and stabilization</b>.
            <br> - It is the <b>most widely studied and researched</b> PSSE methodology.
            <br> - A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the Schroth method has a <b>positive effect</b> on
            subjects with idiopathic scoliosis.
            <br> - -> It showed an <b>almost moderate effect size for reducing the Cobb angle</b> (ES = −0.492). Some
            studies showed a statistically significant reduction in Cobb angle.
            <br> - -> It showed an <b>almost moderate effect size for reducing the Angle of Trunk Rotation (ATR)</b> (ES
            = −0.471), and is the only method shown to significantly reduce ATR.
            <br> - -> It showed a <b>large effect size for improving quality of life</b> (ES = 1.087). Schroth was found
            to significantly improve the domain of functional activity and overall SRS-22 scores.
            <br> - The effectiveness of the Schroth method can be stronger in shorter-term studies, and a positive
            effect can be expected even in severe cases, especially if therapy continues for over a month.
            <br> - The <b>Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School (BSPTS)</b> method is based on the original
            Schroth method, incorporating 3D postural correction, expansion/contraction, stabilization by muscle
            tension, and integration principles.
            <br> - The <b>DoboMed method</b> also includes the rotational angular breathing exercise of Schroth.
            <br><br>
            <b>Other PSSE Methodologies:</b>
            <br> - Other PSSE schools in Europe include <b>SEAS (Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis)</b>,
            <b>BSPTS</b>, <b>FED</b>, <b>FITS (Functional Individual Therapy of Scoliosis)</b>, <b>Lyon</b>, and <b>Side
                Shift</b>.
            <br> - <b>SEAS exercises</b> are based on autocorrection and stabilization, aiming to improve spinal
            stability and address impairments. SEAS, like Schroth, significantly improves quality of life indicators.
            Long-term studies suggest SEAS is effective in preventing Cobb angle progression.
            <br> - <b>BSPTS</b> has also shown effectiveness in stabilizing scoliosis progression, particularly after 1
            year of consistent application.
            <br> - <b>FED</b> uses a mechanotherapy device for 3D stabilization, extension, and derotation. Studies
            suggest it can lead to positive changes in posture and Cobb angle regression/stabilization, with one study
            showing it was advantageous over FITS.
            <br> - <b>FITS</b> focuses on detecting and eliminating myofascial restrictions and building new corrective
            posture patterns.
            <br> - <b>Lyon method</b> includes 3D spine mobilization, patient education, and daily activity correction,
            focusing on avoiding spinal extension and enhancing kyphosis.
            <br> - <b>Side Shift method</b> is based on intensive trunk-bending training.
            <br> - The scientific validity and effectiveness data for <b>DoboMed, FITS, Lyon, and Side Shift are very
                limited or questionable</b> compared to Schroth, SEAS, and BSPTS.
            <br><br>
            <b>Operative Intervention:</b>
            <br> - <b>Surgical fusion</b> is the mainstay of operative treatment for curves over 40-45 degrees in
            skeletally immature individuals. Historically, this included anterior, posterior, or combined approaches.
            <br> - Currently, the leading technique is <b>posterior fusion with pedicle screws and bilateral rod
                placement</b>. Selecting operative levels is a complex decision, considering coronal deformity,
            kyphosis, shoulder height, and lumbar alignment.
            <br> - New non-fusion techniques, such as <b>tethering procedures</b>, are gaining traction.
            <br> - Surgery for scoliosis is a <b>major procedure</b> associated with serious complications.
            <br> - <b>Pre-operative candidates</b> undergo a standard laboratory workup, including CBC, BMP, INR/PTT,
            urinalysis, and a urine pregnancy test for all females. Pulmonary function tests are also included.
            <br> - <b>Postoperative care</b> typically involves management in an ICU, with most patients returning home
            after surgery. Bracing is generally not needed post-operatively.

        <h2>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes</h2>
        The management of scoliosis is complex, and results can be poor. It is best managed by an <b>interprofessional
            team</b> that may include a physical therapist, orthopedic surgeon, pulmonologist, rheumatologist, and
        neurologist. The vast majority of patients do not require surgery and can be managed with non-surgical
        therapies. Post-surgery, nurses should encourage incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis.
        A <b>mental health nurse consultation</b> is recommended for all patients, as scoliosis can impart significant
        cosmetic deficits leading to anxiety, withdrawal, and depression. Many patients with scoliosis avoid sports due
        to fear of embarrassment or humiliation.
        While some pain may be present, prescription-strength pain medications are not empirically prescribed; other
        modalities like TENS, acupuncture, stretching, exercise, and yoga can help. The interprofessional team should
        focus on improving the quality of life rather than offering invasive treatments that might do more harm than
        good.
