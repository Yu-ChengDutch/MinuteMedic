        <h1>Vasculitis</h1>

        <p><b>Vasculitis</b> is the inflammation of blood vessels of various size. Individually, they're called <b>phlebitis</b> when it pertains to veins, and <b>arteritis</b> when it pertains to arteries. A primary division is made based on aetiology:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Primary vasculitis</li>
            <li>Secondary vasculitis</li>
            <li>Single origin vasculitis</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Withing the category of <b>primary vasculitis</b> a further division is made into:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Large vessel vasculitis</li>
            <li>Medium vessel vasculitis</li>
            <li>Small vessel vasculitis</li>
            <li>Variable size vessel vasculitis</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Primary vasculitis</h2>

        <p>To remember what vasculitis belong to what, remember the following:</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">1-2-3, all <b>primary</b> vasculitis have <b>two</b> variants, except <b>small (i.e., nr. 3) vasculitis</b> which has <b>two</b> categories, each with <b>three</b> variants</div>

        <h3>Large vessel vasculitis</h3>

        <p>In this category, we find <b>Takayasu arteritis</b>, also known as <b>aortic arch syndrome</b>, as well as <b>Giant cell arteritis</b> which is also known as <b>temporal arteritis</b>.</p>

        <h3>Medium vessel vasculitis</h3>

        <p>In this category we find <b>polyarteritis nodosa</b> and <b>Kawasaki disease</b>.</p>

        <h3>Small vessel vasculitis</h3>

        <p>As mentioned in the mnemonic, there are two types of <b>small vessel vasculitis</b>, namely <b>ANCA-associated</b> and <b>immune complex-associated</b>. The difference is whether the disease is associated with <b>anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)</b> which are a group of <b>antibodies of the IgG type</b> against antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and monocytes. While it is poorly understood how these ANCAs originate (two theories might be that they're a <b>type II hypersensitivity reaction to chronic infection</b> or <b>a result of defective apoptosis</b>), their direct role in pathogenesis seems to have been proven in animal models. They seem to be able to <b>activate neutrophils</b> which may then adhere to <b>endothelial cells</b> where they start causing an inflammatory chain reaction.</p>
        
        <div class="mnemonic">All of the small vessel vasculitis are refered to as <b>polyangiitis</b>, and both categories have a <b>Nazi eponym</b>.</div>

        <h4>ANCA-associated</h4>

        <p>Of this type, there are three variants: <b>Microscopic polyangiitis (Wegener)</b>, <b>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis</b>, <b>Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis</b>.</p>

        <h4>Immune complex</h4>

        <p>Of this type, there are three variants: <b>Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease</b>, <b>Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis</b>, <b>IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein)</b></p>

        <h3>Primary variable vessel vasculitis</h3>

        <p>Here, we find two diseases that are closely related to the <b>eye</b>, namely: <b>Behçet's disease</b> and <b>Cogan syndrome</b>.</p>

        <h2>Secondary vasculitis</h2>

        <p>These vasculites are associated with systemic inflammtory disorders, namely <b>Lupus vasculitis</b> and <b>Rheumatoid vasculitis</b>.</p>

        <h2>Single-organ vasculitis</h2>

        <p>For some reason, the only described <b>single-organ vasculites</b> are those occuring in <b>ectodermal tissue</b>: nervous system and skin. Here we find the following variants:</p>
        
        <ol>

            <li>Small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis</li>
            <li>Golfer's vasculitis (a.k.a. exercise-induced vasculitis or Disney rash)</li>
            <li>Retinal vasculitis</li>
            <li>Primary central nervous system vasculitis</li>

        </ol>

        <h1>Diagnosis</h1>

        <p>In general, laboratory tests will show elevated markers of inflammation: <b>bezinking, CRP, anaemia, leukocytosis and eosinophilia</b>. Depending on the type of vasculitis, it is possible to find <b>elevated ANCA</b>. However, for a definite diagnosis, a <b>biopsy of involved tissue</b> is necessary. On these biopsies, it is sometimes possible to find <b>leukocytoclasis</b>, which is <b>nuclear debris from infiltrating neutrophils</b>. Alternatively, one could perfrom an <b>angiogram (vessel x-ray)</b> in order to demonstrate a pattern of inflammation. Furthermore, in <b>large vessel vasculites</b> it is useful to perform a <b>FDG-PET/CT</b> which may show enhanced glucose metabolism in the vessels. </p>

        <h1>Treatment</h1>

        <p>Usually, therapy is immunosuppressive using such drugs as <b>prednisone</b> or <b>cyclophosphamide</b>. If an infection plays a role, one might consider antimmicrobial agents.</p>

        <h1>Lymphangitis</h1>

        <p>Just like how blood vessels may inflame, so too may lymphatic channels inflame. This occurs <b>as a result of an infection distal to the channel</b> and it presents as <b>long red streaks spreading away from the site of infection</b>. As the involvement of the lymphatic system <b>allows for rapid spread of the infection</b> it might be a <b>medical emergency</b>. Aetiologically, this disease is most commonly associated with <b>Streptococcus Pyogenes (group A streptococcus)</b>.</p>

        <p>Besides the characteristic <b>clearly demarcated long red streaks spreading away from the infection</b>, this disease may also present with <b>warm skin over the infection, chills, high fever, throbbing pain, oedema</b> or other signs of systemic disease. It also possible to find <b>lymphadenopathy (enlarged, swollen, tender lymph nodes)</b> or signs of sepsis.</p>

        <p>Therapy depends on the extent of spread: if it is local, then <b>debridement</b> and good wound care should suffice. If it has spread further, <b>immediate antibiotic drug therapy</b> is necessary.</p>

        <p><b>NB: Lymphagitis may also occur secondary to a <u>malignancy</u> as the cells spread from a tumour along the vessel, or as a tumour block drainage.</b></p>
