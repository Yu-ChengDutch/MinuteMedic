        <h1>Neuro-oncological classification</h1>

        <p>Within the nervous system, we're going to find common tumours arising from four types of tissue:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Nervous tissue</li>
            <li>Meningeal tissue</li>
            <li>Vascular tissue</li>
            <li>Glandular tissue</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Nervous tissue</h2>
        <p>This tissue is composed of <b>neurons</b> and <b>glial cells or neuroglia</b>. Looking at classifications, we find two different ways to classify neurons, namely <b>functional (sensory, motor and interneurons)</b> or <b>structural (multipolar, bipolar, pseudounipolar and unipolar neurons)</b>. Within the neuroglia then, we find the following types:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Microglial cells: Macrophage cells constituting the primary immune system of the CNS</li>
            <li>Astrocytes: <b>Most abundant</b> cell type in the CNS with many processes</li>
            <li>Oligodendrocytes: Form myelin sheaths within the <b>CNS</b></li>
            <li>Ependymal cells: Line the spinal cord and the ventricular system</li>
            <li>Schwann cells: Form myelin sheaths within the <b>PNS</b></li>
            <li>Satellite glial cells: Line the surfaces of neuron cell bodies in ganglia</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Meningeal tissue</h2>
        <p>The meninges, wrapping around the entire CNS, consist of the <b>dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater</b>. Between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (i.e., the <i>subarachnoid space</i>) there is to be found <b>cerebrospinal fluid</b>. </p>

        <h1>Neuroepithelial tumours</h1>
        <h2>Neuronal origin</h2>
        <p>As neurons hardly proliferate, <b>neuronal tumours are extremely rare</b> and cases are often found on the border between glial cells and neurons. Two examples are expanded on here:</p>
        <h3>Gangliomas</h3>
        <p>These tumours are <b>low-grade tumours</b> containing <b>both neuronal and glial components</b>. Being extremely rare, they represent about <b>1% of brain tumours</b> and primarily affect <b>children and young adults</b>. The most frequent location is the <b>temporal lobe</b> and hence symptoms might include <b>seizures (70-80%), headaches and neurological deficits</b>. As a well-defined, often cystic mass ought to be visible, an MRI is the most common diagnostic tool. Histopathology should then show both mature neurons and glial cells. A <b>BRAF</b> (remember: RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway being responsible for cell growth) is often found. Treatment may include surgical resection, radiation therapy, chemotherapy (reserved for recurrent anaplastic gangliogliomas) and plain seizure management. For "normal" i.e., low-grade WHO grade I gangliogliomas, the prognosis is good.</p>
        <h3>Neurocytomas</h3>
        <p>These tumours are extremely rare, and, being low-grade, have a favourable prognosis. Usually, they arise in the ventricular system, particularly the <b>septum pellucidum</b> (thin membrane separating the anterior horns of the left and right lateral ventricles). Symptoms usually arise following increased intracranial pressure, they involve <b>headaches, nausea/vomiting, visual disturbances, cognitive/behavioural change and seizures</b>. The described rarity means they constitue about <b>0.1-0.5% of all intracranial tumours</b>, often affecting <b>young adults</b>. While a CT suffices to detect early signs of hydrocephalus, an MRI is needed to conclusively diagnosis a central neurocytoma. The most typical therapeutic option is complete resection, while a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt may help bridge the period until surgery. </p>
    
        <h2>Glial origin (i.e., gliomas)</h2>
        <h3>Astrocytomas</h3>
        <p>These common tumours, arising from astrocytes, come in four different types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>WHO grade I: Pilocytic astrocytoma</li>
            <li>WHO grade II: Diffuse astrocytoma</li>
            <li>WHO grade III: Anaplastic astrocytoma</li>
            <li>WHO grade IV: Glioblastoma</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Together, they constitute nearly <b>30% of all NCS tumours</b> with the lower-grade astrocytomas being more common in children, and high-grade types being more prevalent in the elderly. Concerning symptomatology, the main symptoms purely based of the tumour itself are <b>seziures and focal neurological deficits</b> while increased intracranial pressure may cause associated issues. While surgical resection often suffices for low-grade and well-accesible tumours, radiation/chemotherapy is often needed for higher grade tumours. Low-grade tumours have a favourable pronosis, with the 5-year survival for pilocytic astrocytomas being <b>60-80%</b> and for diffuse astrocytomas <b>40-50%</b>; high-grade astrocytomas often offer survival of <b>less than a year</b>.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the <b>glioblastoma</b> is the <b>most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults</b>. It mostly occurs >50 y/o and is characterised histopathologically with a high degree of cellularity, marked atypia, necrosis and microvascular proliferation.</p>

        <h3>Oligodendroglioma</h3>
        <p>This rare tumours originates in the <b>oligodendrocytes</b> and forms about <b>5% of all primary CNS tumours</b>. It most commonly forms in <b>30-50 y/o</b>. While an MRI might show calcifications, histopathology will show a "fried egg appearance". However, prognosis is favourable with a 5-year survival rate of <b>70-90%</b>.</p>

        <h3>Ependymomas</h3>
        <p>These rare tumour originate from the inner lining of the ventricles, and hence present with an obstructive hydrocephalus: <b>headaches, nausea, vomiting</b>. When presenting with a spinal cord ependymoma, patients may experience back pain and weakness, while a brain tumoiur might instead give seizures and focal deficits. It constitutes around <b>2-3% of all CNS tumours</b>.</p>
        <p>A special kind of ependymoma is the so-called <b>choroid-plexus tumour</b> which originates on the choroid plexus of which we have one in each of the four ventricles. It is separated in choroid plexus <b>papillomas and carcinomas</b> and mostly affects children <b>under the age of 5</b>. Symptoms again are associated with hydrocephalus, while <b>failure to thrive</b> is often seen in infants. Carcinomas, while rarer than papillomas have a significantly <b>less favourable</b> prognosis.</p>

        <h1>Meningiomas</h1>
        <p>As the meninges occur all around the CNS, symptomatology strongly varies based on location. Most commonly however, meningiomas arise from the <b>convexities of the brain: falx cerebri, sphenoid wing and posterior fossa</b>, while the <b>thoracic spine</b> most often provides origin to spinal meningiomas. They are the <b>most common primary intracranial tumour in adults</b>, providing about <b>30-35%</b> of primary brain tumours with the prevalence in women being about twice as high as compared to men. As meningiomas may often be symptomatic, in such cases mere observation is not necessarily out of the question. Otherwise, complete resection is the treatment of choice.</p>
        <p>Low-grade, i.e., non-brain invasive, meningiomas, may be separated into three classes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Meningiothelial meningiomas: <b>most common type</b> which consists of cells resembling the arachnoid cap</li>
            <li>Fibrous meningiomas: tough, hard-to-resect tumours consisting of fibroblasts</li>
            <li>Transitional meningiomas: mixed-type meningiomas containing lobules of both</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Other tumours</h1>
        <h2>Pineal tumours</h2>
        <p>These tumours occur in two different variants: <b>pineocytomas (benign & slow) and pineoblastomas (malignant & aggresive)</b>. Symptoms include those associated with hydrocephalus, as well as <b>Parinaud's syndrome (upwards gaze palsy or even "setting-sun sign", Argyll Robertson-pupils, nystagmus, and Collier's sign), and hormonal changes such as an altered sleep-wake cycle.</b>. Being extremely rare, it accounts for <b>less than 1%</b> of primary brain tumours and is most commo in children. Surgery is often complex following the location, but stereotactic resection or radiation therapy may nevertheless be attempted. </p>

        <h2>Embryonic nervous tumours</h2>
        <p>These Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumours (PNETs) arise from the <b>embryonic neuroectoderm</b> and then remain undifferentiated. Often, these cells are found to have chromosomal or <b>TP53</b> (tumour suppressor gene) abnormalities. They may occur in two main locaitons:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Medulloblastoma: cerebellar tumour. <b>Most common malignant brain tumour in children!</b></li>
            <li>Supratentorial PNETs: arrise in the cerebral hemispheres</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Symptomatology then, is highly dependant on location of the tumour. Medulloblastomas are more often found to cause <b>ataxia, headache, nausea, vomiting</b> while the supratentorial variant causes seizures and focal neurological deficits. </p>

        <div class="mnemonic">In general, <b>medullo</b>blastomas dominate until <b>middle</b>school, and after that are <b>meningomas & glioblastomas</b></div>
