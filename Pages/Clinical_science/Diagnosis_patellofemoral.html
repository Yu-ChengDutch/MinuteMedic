        <h1>Patellofemoral Syndrome</h1>
        <h2>Overview and Nomenclature</h2>
        <p>Patellofemoral syndrome (PFS), also known as <b>patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)</b> and <b>runner's
                knee</b>,
            is recognized as one of the most common causes of anterior knee pain seen by clinicians. Other names include
            retropatellar pain syndrome, lateral facet compression syndrome, or idiopathic anterior knee pain. PFS is
            considered a <b>diagnosis of exclusion</b>, meaning other intra-articular or peripatellar pathologies must
            be
            ruled out before confirming the diagnosis.</p>
        <h2>Etiology (Causes)</h2>
        <p>
            The cause of PFS is likely multifactorial, and no clear consensus exists, though training practices are
            often implicated. The syndrome is thought to involve six anatomic areas: subchondral bone, synovium,
            retinaculum, skin, nerve, and muscle. Four major contributing factors have been identified:

        <ol>
            <li><b>Overactivity and Overload:</b> Overuse appears to be the most important factor. Patients often
                describe
                that pain began during a period of increased activity or increased workload on the joint, such as miles
                ran
                or volume of work. Risk factors for overload include a BMI greater than 25, prior fitness level, and
                prior exercise regimen.</li>
            <li><b>Malalignment and Muscular Imbalance:</b> This involves static components (e.g., leg length
                discrepancies, hamstring tightness, abnormal foot morphology) and dynamic components (e.g., muscle
                weakness, ground reaction forces). Hip abductor weakness may play a major role. Tight hamstrings can
                increase compressive forces across the patellofemoral joint.</li>
            <li><b>Trauma:</b> Direct or indirect injuries to the patellar area can cause damage to structures leading
                to PFS.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
            The diagnosis relies heavily on a detailed history and physical examination. Patients typically complain of
            generalized anterior knee pain that is usually <b>poorly localized</b> and felt <b>behind or around the
                patella</b>. The pain is described as achy, though it can also be sharp. Symptoms are worsened by
            <b>loading a flexed knee</b>, which occurs during activities like running, squatting, climbing stairs, and
            prolonged
            sitting.
            The diagnosis of PFS is typically clinical. Imaging, such as plain radiographs, is usually reserved for
            cases where symptoms fail to improve after one to two months of conservative management, as imaging is used
            primarily to rule out other causes like loose bodies, occult fracture, or osteoarthritis.
        </p>
        <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Treatment is typically <b>conservative</b>, focusing on pain reduction, improving patellar tracking, and
            restoring function.


        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Acute Phase:</b> This involves activity modification, ice, and NSAID use. NSAIDs have been shown to
                decrease overall pain but are usually not recommended for long-term treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Recovery Phase:</b> This phase seeks to correct the underlying dysfunction. The <b>most effective
                    intervention is the combination of knee and hip exercises</b> designed to increase lower extremity
                strength,
                mobility, and function.
            </li>
            <li><b>Adjunct Therapy:</b> Patellar taping can be used to decrease pain when combined with physical
                therapy.</li>
            <li>
                Referral to orthopedic surgery is considered a last resort, and non-operative therapy should be pursued
                for up to 24 months before considering operative interventions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Prognosis</h2>
        <p>
            The prognosis for PFS is generally good, with studies showing that up to two-thirds of patients can be
            successfully treated with a proper rehabilitation protocol. However, approximately <b>40% of patients
                experience continued symptoms one year</b> after typical treatment.
            A potential complication of PFS is the development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis, which may result from
            inadequate tracking of the patella.
