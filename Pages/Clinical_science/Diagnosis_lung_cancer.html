        <h1>Introduction to Lung Cancer</h1>
        <p><b>Lung cancer</b> is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 1.8 million deaths annually. Its pathogenesis is deeply intertwined with the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system, as well as environmental and genetic factors.</p>
        
        <h2>Anatomical Considerations</h2>
        <p>The <b>lungs</b> are paired organs responsible for gas exchange, divided into lobes (three on the right, two on the left). The <b>bronchial tree</b> branches into progressively smaller airways, terminating in alveoli. The <b>blood supply</b> is dual: the pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood for gas exchange, while the bronchial arteries supply oxygenated blood to lung tissue itself. This complex architecture explains why lung cancers may arise from epithelial cells (bronchi, alveoli), neuroendocrine cells, or mesenchymal tissues.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Lung cancer was rare before the 20th century. The <b>rise of cigarette smoking</b> in the 1920s led to an epidemic, with Richard Doll's 1950 study definitively linking smoking to carcinoma. The discovery of <b>oncogenes (e.g., EGFR, KRAS)</b> and <b>tumor suppressors (e.g., p53)</b> in the late 20th century revolutionized our understanding of molecular pathogenesis.</p>
        
        <h2>Physiological Basis</h2>
        <p>Normal lung epithelium undergoes <b>continuous renewal</b> via basal stem cells. Carcinogens (e.g., tobacco smoke) cause <b>DNA mutations</b> that disrupt apoptosis and promote uncontrolled proliferation. The lung's <b>high oxygen tension</b> may exacerbate oxidative DNA damage. Additionally, the <b>rich lymphatic drainage</b> facilitates early metastatic spread to hilar and mediastinal nodes.</p>

        <h1>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</h1>
        <p>Accounting for <b>85%</b> of cases, NSCLC includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. These share similar treatment paradigms but differ in etiology and molecular profile.</p>
        
        <h2>Adenocarcinoma</h2>
        <p><b>Risk factors:</b> Smoking (though 20% occur in never-smokers), radon exposure, asbestos. More common in <b>women</b> and <b>East Asians</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Arises from <b>peripheral glandular cells</b>. Common mutations include <b>EGFR, ALK, ROS1</b>. Often produces <b>mucin</b> visible on histology.</p>

            <b>Mnemonic: "Adeno Cancers Like East Asia"</b> - Adenocarcinoma is Associated with EGFR mutations, Common in non-smokers, and Linked to East Asian ethnicity.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2>
        <p><b>Risk factors:</b> Strongly smoking-related. Associated with <b>COPD</b> due to chronic inflammation.</p>
        <p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Originates in <b>central bronchi</b>, showing keratin pearls and intercellular bridges. Often expresses <b>p40</b> and has <b>FGFR1 amplifications</b>.</p>
