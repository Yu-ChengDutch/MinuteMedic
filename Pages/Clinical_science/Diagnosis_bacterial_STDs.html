        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be separated into categories based on aetiology:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Bacteria: Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis</li>
            <li>Virus: Genital warts (HPV), genital herpes, HIV/AIDS</li>
            <li>Parasites: Trichomoniasis</li>

        </ol>
        
        <p>In the developed world, diagnostic tests are easily available but the situation is different in the developing world. However, even without HIV/AIDS, roughly 1.1 billion people wordlwide currently have STDs. Roughly 500 milion have syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis, and an additional 530 milion suffer from genital warts. </p>

        <h1>Bacterial STDs</h1>

        <h2>Chlamydia</h2>

        <p>Caused by <b>C. Trachomatis</b>, a <b>gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium</b>, it is <b>the most common bacterial STD in humans</b> and the <b>leading cause of infectious blindness</b>. It is transmitted during sex or direct contacted with infected tissue; or from mother to child during childbirth. It is diagnosed using <b>PCR</b> from a swab performed on the <b>cervix or urethra</b> or even on <b>voided urine</b>.</p>

        <p><b>70%</b> of infected women remain <b>asymptomatic</b>, but about <b>50% of asymptomatic</b> female patients will develop <b>pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</b> which may develop into scarring inside the reproductive organs, which in turn may develop into <b>chronic pelvic pain, fertility problems, ectopic pregancy and other complications</b>. When they do become symptomatic, women often display <b>vaginal bleeding or discharge, abdominal pain, painful intercourse, fever, painful urination or urinary urgency</b>. Hence, screening is recommended in those under 25 or others at risk of infection.</p>

        <p><b>50%</b> of men remain asymptomatic, and the other half shows <b>urethritis</b> which presents as <b>painful urination, penile discharge, testicular pain/swelling, fever</b>. If untreated, it may cause <b>epididymitis</b> which could rarely lead to sterility. Potentially, it could also cause <b>prostatitis</b> but this is uncertain.</p>

        <h3>Trachoma</h3>

        <p>Caused by the same pathogen, <b>trachoma</b> is a <b>chronic conjunctivitis</b> which may be transmitted from eye to eye by fingers i.e., shared towels or cloths, coughing, sneezing, eye-seeking flies etc.</p>
        <p>It presents as <b>mucopurulent ocular discharge, irritation, redness and lid swelling</b>. The WHO aims to have erradicated this disease by <b>2030</b> using hygiene measures.</p>

        <h3>Other complications</h3>

        <p>Patients may develop <b>reactive arthritis</b>, presenting with the triad of <b>conjunctivitis, arthritis and urethral inflammation</b> which occurs especially in <b>young men</b>.</p>
        <p>A different serovar may cause <b>lymphogranuloma venereum</b> which is an <b>infection of the lymph nodes and lymphatics</b>. It presents as <b>genital ulceration and lymphadenopathy in the groin</b>, but may include <b>rectal inflammation, fever or generalised lymphadenopathy</b>.</p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>

        <p>Chlamydia should be treated using macrolides, most effectively so by <b>azithromycin, single dose</b>. After three months, the patient should be tested again to check for reinfectin. Partners should also be treated.</p>

        <h2>Gonorrhea</h2>

        <p>Caused by <b>Neisseria gonorrhoea</b>, a <b>gram-negative diplococcus bacterum</b>, it has severe complications when untreated. It may be diagnosed in the location where infection happened: urethra/vagina/cervix urine, throat, or rectum. It is recommended to test all women under 25, MSMs and those with new sexual partners.</p>
        <p>It usually presents <b>2-14 days after infection</b>, with most symptoms appearing <b>4-6 days after infection</b>. It initially causes <b>local swelling, itching, pain and pus formation</b>. For example in throat gonorrhea, it causes a sore through (altough <b>90%</b> remain asymptomatic).</p>
        <p>When it comes to genital gonorrhea, <b>50% of women remain asymptomatic</b> but the others experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or painful intercourse. This too may cause pelvic inflammatory disease.</p>
        <p>When men become symptomatic (around <b>50%</b> of cases), it results in <b>urethritis</b> which causes <b>painful urination and discharge from the penis</b>. Similarly, this may cause epidimytis and is associated with a risk of prostate cancer and sterility.</p>

        <h3>Neonatal conjunctivitis / Opthalmia neonatorum</h3>

        <p>When children are born to women with either Chlamydia or Gonorrhea, children might develop neonatal conjunctivitis presenting as <b>crusty, purulent eyes</b>. When resulting from gonorrhea it will present <b>before 5 days after birth</b> while if resulting from Chlamydia it will present <b>5-14 days</b> after birth.</p>

        <h3>Complications</h3>

        <p>When left untreated, it may spread from the original site to joints, skin and other organs. Rarely, it may settle in the heart (<b>endocarditis</b>) or spinal column (<b>meningitis</b>). It is also possible to be allergic to N. Gonorrhea.</p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>

        <p>Gonorrhea should be treated by <b>IV ceftriaxone</b> or <b>azithromycin per os</b>, altough antibiotic resistance is starting to play a big role. <b>Ertapenem</b> is a good solution when gonorrhea has become resistant. Sexual partners need to be treated too.</p>

        <h2>Syphilis</h2>

        <p>Caused by <b>Treponema Pallidum</b>, a <b>spiral-shaped, gram-negative, highly mobile bacterium</b>. Diagnosis then is made using <b>blood tests</b>, <b>CSF tests for neurosyphilis</b> or <b>direct testing of a chancre using dark field microscopy or PCR tests</b>.</p>
        <p>Syphilis presents itself in stages and for its varied presentation was called "the great imitator":</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Primary (2-6 weeks): presents with a <b>single, firm, painless, non-ichy chancre</b> in <b>40% of cases</b>. Else, it could present as multiple laesions, which may be tender and which be located in other places than the genitals. The main location for women is the cervix and for men the penis. Around <b>80%</b> of patients have lymphadenopathy around the area of infection.</li>
            <li>Secondary (4-10 weeks): presents as a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on trunk and extremities including palms and soles. The rash may become <b>maculopapular or pustular</b>. It may also present more generalised as <b>fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss etc.</b> which is not always preceded by a chancre</li>
            <li>Latent: during <b>early latent phase</b> (under 2 years) includes having serologic proof of infection without symptoms but with 25% risk of recurrent secondary infection, while <b>late latent phase</b> (i.e., after 2 years) could last many years and sees people being less infectious</li>
            <li>Tertiary (3-15 years): gummatous syphilis, neurosyphilis or cardiovascular syphilis</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Gummatous syphilis</h3>

        <p>The most benign form of <b>tertiary disease</b>, it may occur up to <b>46 years</b> after initial exposure and is characterised by the formation of chronic gummas which are <b>soft, tumour-like balls of inflammation of varying size</b>. They may occur everywhere but typically affect the <b>skin, bone, and liver</b>.</p>

        <h3>Cardiovascular syphilis</h3>

        <p>Typically occuring 10-30 years after infection, it most commonly results in <b>syphilitic aortitis</b> which may result in the formation of an <b>aortic aneurysm</b>.</p>

        <h3>neurosyphilis and meningovascular syphilis</h3>

        <p>Neurosyphilis involves and infection of the central nervous system, which may occur at any stage of the infection.</p>
        <p>In an early stage, meningitis is the most common presentation, usually arising within <b>one year after infection</b>, possibly infecting the cranial nerves. Similar symptoms may be mimicked by <b>cerebral gummas</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Meningovascular syphilis</b> is considered an intermediate stage, where CNS vessels inflame and occlude which causes <b>ischemia</b> and thus may present as <b>stroke</b> or <b>spinal cord injury</b> with the Middle Cerebral Artery being the most common target.</p>
        <p><b>Parenchymal syphilis</b> would be considere late-stage as it occurs <b>15-25 years</b> after initial infection. It presents as <b>tabes dorsalis (degeneration of the dorsal roots, which causes severe pain when coughing, and sensory ataxia), as well as general paresis</b>. Besides pain and ataxia, tabes dorsalis may present with ataxic wide-based bait, paresthesias, loss of position and vibratory sense, Charcot joints and reduced reflexes. Similarly, there may be an <b>Argyll Robertson pupil</b>. Due to overall damage to the brain, neuropsychiatric symptoms may slowly appear.</p>
        <p>Any part of the eye may be involved in neurosyphilis, most commonly the uvea resulting in <b>uveitis</b>. Similarly, otosyphilis refers to an infection of the N. Vestibulocochlearis presenting as issues with hearing and balance. </p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>

        <p>Syphils is highly sensitive to penicillin, and in primary or secondary stages the treatment consists of <b>intramuscular benzylpenicillin</b>, which renders them non-infective in 24 hours. When allergic, <b>doxycyline</b> and <b>tetracycline</b> are safe alternatives. For neurosyphilis, <b>intravenous penicillin G</b> is given for <b>10 days</b>.</p>
        <p>A complication of treatment is the <b>Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction</b> which springs from a <b>release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a response to lipoproteins released from rupturing syphils bacteria</b>. It starts within a day, and presents as <b>fever, muscle pains, headache, tachycardia and rash</b>.</p>
