        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Upper limb (UL) amputations involve the removal of any part of the upper extremity due to surgery, trauma, or
            pathology. These amputations significantly impact an individual's life, affecting physical functionality,
            social engagement, self-esteem, psychosocial well-being, and employment prospects. The complex multi-joint
            movements and functions of the human upper limb are challenging to replicate with prostheses. A critical
            limitation and common reason for prosthesis refusal is the lack of purposely delivered sensory feedback,
            which affects control and hinders the device's integration into the user's body schema. Proprioception,
            defined as the sense of position, movement, tension, force, effort, and balance, is crucial for dexterous
            and effortless body movement. This summary will explore the epidemiology, assessment, rehabilitation,
            current prosthetic models, future developments, and the vital role of proprioception in upper limb
            prostheses.</p>

        <h1>Epidemiology</h1>

        <p>Upper limb amputations are less prevalent than lower limb amputations, accounting for about 10% of all limb
            losses. A significant estimation from 2017 indicated over 20 million people globally living with an upper
            limb amputation due to traumatic causes. The primary cause of UL amputations in general is trauma, often
            stemming from work-related accidents such as crush injuries, electrical burns, gunshot wounds, or combat
            injuries. These traumatic amputations typically affect individuals aged 20-40, with a male-to-female ratio
            of 4:1. The most frequent major upper limb amputation is at the transradial level (below elbow), accounting
            for over half of all major arm amputations. Non-traumatic UL amputations are primarily due to cancer or
            tumors, which often result in more extensive amputations like shoulder disarticulation. Other causes include
            congenital anomalies, thermal or electrical injury, frostbites, dysvascular disease, and infection.</p>

        <h1>Assessment and Prognosis</h1>

        <p>
            <b>Assessment</b> for upper limb amputations involves a multidisciplinary approach. Key components include:
            <br> - <b>History:</b> Reason for amputation, co-morbid injuries, handedness, future vocational/recreational
            goals, baseline functional status (including cognition), musculoskeletal history (contralateral limb and
            cervical spine), and social history (support system, home/work environment).
            <br> - <b>Physical Examination:</b> Visual inspection of the residual limb for length, volume, atrophy,
            incisional healing, wounds, scar tissue, and shape. It also includes bilateral upper extremity (UE) range of
            motion (ROM) and muscle strength (including scapular/glenohumeral joint), neck ROM, sensation, and
            cognition.
            <br> - <b>Functional Assessment:</b> Evaluation of specific UE movements (e.g., scapular
            protraction/retraction, shoulder flexion/extension for body-powered prostheses, and suitable muscle sites
            for myoelectric prostheses). Early assessment of independence level, hand dominance, and Activities of Daily
            Living (ADLs) performance is recommended, utilizing standardized assessments like the Box and Block test or
            the Activities Measure for UE Amputation (AM-ULA).
            <br> - <b>Imaging:</b> X-rays to assess for bony fragments or degenerative joint diseases; MRI/CT for tumor
            diagnosis, infection assessment, and surgical planning; Technetium bone scans for osteomyelitis;
            Ultrasonography for soft tissue injuries; and Doppler ultrasonography to assess blood supply for wound
            healing.
            <br> - <b>Supplemental Tools:</b> Electromyography (EMG)/Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) to identify optimal
            surgical plans or reasons for non-progression, and myoelectric control training with EMG or pattern
            recognition feedback to assess remaining musculature for sensor placement.

            <br><br><b>Prognosis:</b>
            <br>Pre-amputation function, level, and cause of amputation significantly impact functional outcomes, with
            higher-level amputations generally leading to greater limitations. <b>Early prosthetic fitting and training
                are major factors for prosthetic acceptance and rehabilitation success</b>. Studies show a 93%
            rehabilitation success rate and 100% return-to-work rate for those fit within 30 days, compared to 42% and
            15% respectively for those fit later. However, the rejection rate for UL prostheses is higher than for lower
            extremity prostheses, reaching as high as 44% in recent studies. Reasons for rejection include lack of
            training, development of one-handedness, non-cosmetic appearance, discomfort, weight, and cost.
            Psychological care is crucial due to high rates of psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder
            (71%), suicide ideation (30.5%), and PTSD (20.3%) in traumatic UE amputees.
        </p>

        <h1>Rehabilitation</h1>

        <p>
            Upper limb amputation rehabilitation follows a phased approach:
            <br> - <b>Phase 0: Pre-operation Education:</b> Often not possible due to the traumatic nature of UL
            amputations, but beneficial for elective procedures to educate patients on potential post-surgery abilities.
            <br> - <b>Phase 1: Immediate Postoperative Management:</b> Focuses on wound care, edema reduction, residual
            limb shaping, pain control, scar tissue management, contracture prevention, total body muscle endurance and
            strengthening, changing hand dominance, basic ADLs training, psychological support, and home/DME assessment.
            <br> - <b>Phase 2: Pre-prosthetic Training:</b> Aims to prepare patients for prosthesis use by enhancing
            endurance, mobility, and strength, focusing on specific motor skills like scapular movement. Myoelectric
            users undergo myosite testing. This phase includes ROM, physical conditioning, desensitization, and limb
            shaping, concluding with prosthesis acquisition.
            <br> - <b>Phase 3: Intermediate Prosthetic Training:</b> Goals include increasing prosthesis wear time,
            mastering control, expanding the functional envelope, and integrating the prosthesis into activities.
            <br> - <b>Phase 4: Advanced Prosthetic Training:</b> Highly individualized, focusing on vocational and
            avocational goals, often involving tool use or onsite work assessments for environmental modifications. The
            aim is energy conservation, minimized biomechanical stress, and return to pre-injury activities.
            <br><br>Regular follow-up with a multidisciplinary team (physiatrists, physical therapists, occupational
            therapists, prosthetists, psychologists) is essential throughout all phases.

        <h1>Prosthetics</h1>

        <p>
            <b>Current Available Models</b>
            <br>The main components of a prosthetic prescription include the socket, suspension, interface, and terminal
            device (TD). There are three general classes of upper extremity prostheses:
            <br> - <b>Passive Functional/Cosmetic:</b> Mimic the appearance of the non-affected limb, providing balance
            aid and opposition, but limited functional utility.
            <br> - <b>Body-Powered/Conventional:</b> Operated by a cable and harness system, controlled by specific body
            movements. Advantages include durability, lighter weight, lower cost, and <b>proprioceptive feedback</b>
            through the harness. They are generally more tolerant to wet/dirty environments and may require shorter
            training periods.
            <br> - <b>Myoelectric/External Power:</b> Powered by batteries and controlled by EMG signals from muscle
            contractions. They offer increased functional movements, better cosmesis, increased pinch/grip force, and
            reduced/eliminated harnessing for comfort and ROM. Myoelectric systems can provide digital (on/off) or
            proportional control, where motor velocity is proportional to EMG signal amplitude, allowing variable speed
            and force.
            <br> - <b>Hybrid:</b> Combine elements of body-powered and external power systems, aiming for a balance of
            weight, cost, grip force, and reduced harnessing.

            <br><br><b>Specific Components:</b>
            <br> - <b>Terminal Devices (TDs):</b> Include passive, body-powered hooks/hands, and externally powered
            hooks/hands. Hooks are durable and provide lateral/tip pinch. Hands offer a 3-jaw chuck pinch, with newer
            multiarticulate hands offering more grip options. Voluntary opening (VO) TDs are most practical as tension
            doesn't need to be maintained to hold objects.
            <br> - <b>Wrists:</b> Range from friction control units for passive pronosupination to locking/quick
            disconnect wrists for rapid interchange of TDs, and spring-assisted wrist flexion for bilateral amputees.
            <br> - <b>Elbows:</b> Body-powered elbows can have spring-assisted flexion and a locking mechanism.
            Externally powered elbows can be controlled with switches or myoelectric signals.
            <br> - <b>Shoulders:</b> Most allow passive abduction and flexion, with desired position maintained by
            friction or lock. Powered shoulders are available for high-level amputations.
            <br> - <b>Sockets:</b> Typically double-walled, made of carbon graphite or plastic resin, fabricated from a
            cast of the residual limb. Flexible inner sockets and frame designs can accommodate volume changes.
            <br> - <b>Suspension Systems:</b> Include harnesses (e.g., figure 8 for transradial/transhumeral amputees),
            anatomical (self-suspension) systems, silicone sleeves (creating negative pressure/adhesive bond, useful for
            delicate skin), and suction suspension (preferred for transhumeral externally controlled devices, requiring
            intimate fit).

            <br><br><b>Future Developments</b>
            <br>Advancements in upper limb prosthetics are continually striving to recreate the complex functions of the
            human hand. Key areas of development include:
            <br> - <b>Osseointegration:</b> A surgical technique where a device is inserted directly into the residual
            limb bone, eliminating traditional sockets to improve suspension, mobility, and quality of life.
            <br> - <b>Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR):</b> Motor nerves are reimplanted into denervated muscles to
            create new myoelectric control sites, allowing more intuitive control and potentially restoring sensation.
            <br> - <b>Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI) Surgery:</b> Utilizes natural agonist-antagonist
            muscle coupling to enhance motor control and proprioceptive sensory feedback.
            <br> - <b>Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (bions):</b> Miniature electrodes transmit EMG signals wirelessly,
            demonstrating greater reliability, less impedance, and improved resistance to fibrosis compared to surface
            electrodes.
            <br> - <b>Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNI) Surgery:</b> Places free peripheral nerve endings
            into muscle or dermal grafts to reduce neuroma and phantom limb pain, and can bioamplify motor action
            potentials for more complex prosthesis control.
            <br> - <b>Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR):</b> Used to enhance rehabilitation by reducing pain,
            improving prosthetic training, and promoting prosthesis usage. AR feedback, for example, has been
            successfully integrated into sensorimotor control loops, allowing users to adapt their behavior.
            <br> - <b>Pattern Recognition-based Myoelectric Control:</b> Algorithms correlate specific EMG patterns with
            preprogrammed upper limb actions, enabling simultaneous control of multiple degrees of freedom and more
            intuitive operation.
            <br> - <b>Powered Terminal Devices:</b> Coupled with TMR, these offer refined sensory feedback, potentially
            restoring some sensations and improving control.
            <br> - <b>3D Printing:</b> Used to develop more affordable, personalized prostheses, especially for
            pediatric patients and in underserved areas.

        <h1>Proprioception</h1>

        <p>
            Proprioception, encompassing the senses of position, movement, tension, force, and effort, is essential for
            skilled and effortless body movements. Despite its key role, most research on supplemental feedback for
            prosthetics has focused on touch restitution, leaving a major knowledge gap in comprehensive analysis of
            proprioceptive feedback.

            <br><br><b>Challenges in Restitution:</b>
            <br>Emulating the richness of physiological sensory return artificially is a primary hurdle. This complex
            process is hindered by:
            <br> - Time-consuming signal processing and transmission.
            <br> - Large area required for components relative to available skin surface.
            <br> - Need for repeated calibrations for reliable sensation and perception.
            <br> - <b>Inability of current technology to elicit force and heaviness sensation in a homomodal (same
                sensory system/modality) way</b>.

            <br><br><b>Non-Invasive Strategies for Proprioception Restitution:</b>
            <br>These strategies aim to extract information from instrumented prostheses and convey it to the user's
            remaining sensory system.
            <br> - <b>Vibrotactile Stimulation:</b> Applied directly to the skin via mechanical vibration, modulating
            frequency and amplitude to convey information. It can generate a kinesthetic illusion by stimulating muscle
            spindle afferents. While low-power and embeddable, it suffers from habituation and low spatial resolution.
            Studies show mixed results: some report improved accuracy in matching tasks, while others show no
            improvement or even detrimental effects. More recently, while not always improving performance over vision,
            it was preferred by users.
            <br> - <b>Electrotactile Stimulation:</b> Delivers electric current to the skin, causing nerve endings to
            fire. Advantages include flexibility in parameters, good spatial resolution, and small electrode size.
            However, it can cause sharp/burning pain and requires frequent calibration. It is faster and requires less
            power than vibrotactile devices. It has been effective for hand aperture, wrist rotation, and finger flexion
            feedback, showing high success rates for both able-bodied and amputee subjects.
            <br> - <b>Skin-Stretch Stimulation:</b> Haptic devices that stretch or apply pressure to the skin. They are
            accurate with good intensity range and resolution. They are capable of transmitting complex combinations of
            velocity, timing, and static force sense. <b>Skin stretch generally provides a more intuitive mapping for
                position and a more realistic sense of velocity compared to vibrotactile feedback</b>. However, they can
            be heavy, cumbersome, energy-consuming, and have slow responses due to mechanical inertia. Examples include
            devices for cursor movement, virtual elbow angle, hand aperture, and integrating with tendon-vibration
            illusion (TVI).
            <br> - <b>Auditory Sensory Substitution (Sonification):</b> Encodes afferent information by modulating
            pitch, timbre, or volume of sounds. It is light, fast, and low-power, leveraging the strong association
            between auditory and motor areas. However, it interferes with normal hearing and requires significant
            attentional resources. Results in proprioceptive substitution have been modest.
            <br> - <b>Augmented Reality (AR) Feedback:</b> Increases visual information via head-mounted displays. It
            has been successfully integrated into sensorimotor control, allowing users to decouple information and
            execute tasks more consistently. Similar to auditory feedback, it can interfere with normal vision and
            requires additional devices.

            <br><br><b>Kinesthetic vs. Kinetic Feedback:</b>
            <br> - <b>Kinesthetic Feedback (Position, Movement, Configuration):</b> Muscle spindles are key
            physiological receptors for position and movement. In prosthetics, rotary encoders or biomimetic approaches
            can emulate muscle length changes. Cutaneous mechanoreceptors also contribute to kinesthetic senses.
            Vibrotactile and skin-stretch stimulations are common strategies for this.
            <br> - <b>Kinetic Feedback (Force, Tension, Effort):</b> Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are responsible for
            sensing tendon tension and muscle load. Artificial sensing can use tension sensors or measure current fed to
            prosthetic motors. While vibrotactile devices can create kinesthetic sensations homomodally, a
            force/heaviness sensation cannot be elicited in this way with current technology. Electrotactile stimulation
            and AR feedback have shown promise in conveying grasping force information. EMG activity itself, as an
            anticipatory input, has also been shown to improve force control.

            <br><br><b>Impact and Future Directions:</b>
            <br>While no single "best approach" for non-invasive proprioceptive feedback has emerged, vibrotactile,
            electrotactile, and skin-stretch stimulation have shown better and more consistent results, considering both
            kinesthetic and grip force information.
            <br> - <b>Motor Control:</b> Proprioceptive feedback can reduce performance variability. While vision is
            dominant in simple tasks, <b>proprioceptive inputs are crucial for coordinating multi-joint movements in
                more complex prostheses</b>. Longer training periods are often needed for users to integrate new
            artificial feedback into their sensorimotor dynamics.
            <br> - <b>Prosthesis Embodiment:</b> Proprioceptive feedback has the potential to enhance the sense of
            owning and controlling artificial limbs by promoting inter-sensory congruency. This is less extensively
            studied for proprioception than for touch feedback, but promising results have been found with peripheral
            nerve stimulation and TVI in nerve-transfer patients.
            <br> - <b>Cognitive Load:</b> Additional feedback can reduce the cognitive load required to control a
            prosthesis, freeing attentional resources that would otherwise be dedicated to constant visual monitoring.
            Physiological parameters like fNIRS, EEG, ECG, and EDA can be used to objectively measure this reduction.
            <br> - <b>Brain Plasticity and Phantom Limb Pain (PLP):</b> Proprioceptive inputs continuously update
            internal models for motor planning. Measuring neurophysiological parameters (e.g., SEPs, MEPs) can provide
            objective evidence of artificial input's influence on cognitive processes. Given that plastic changes in
            sensorimotor circuits are believed to underlie PLP, and proprioception plays a key role, investigating the
            effects of artificial proprioception on cortical plasticity and phantom limb phenomena is crucial for
            amputees. Providing congruent proprioceptive information from an artificial limb could address the
            "defective opening" in the prosthetic motor control loop.

            <br><br>Further technological development is needed for smaller, lower-power stimulators and better encoding
            algorithms. Evaluation should move beyond single-modality assessments to integrated, ecological tasks that
            better reflect real-life use and allow for longer training periods.
