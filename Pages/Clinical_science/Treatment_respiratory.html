        <h1>Types of medication in respiratory medicine</h1>

        <p>For the treatment of the most common respiratory conditions, we know three classes of medication:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Beta2-agonists</li>
            <li>Muscarinic antagonists</li>
            <li>Corticosteroids</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Importantly, besides these, there are so-called <b>phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors</b> which are used in patients with <b>severe COPD with frequent exacerbations</b>. An important example thereof is <b>Roflumilast</b>.</p>

        <h2>Bronchodilators</h2>
        <p>There are two kinds of bronchodilators, namely <b>Beta2-agonists</b> and <b>muscarinic antagonists</b>. While both help to reduce airway spasms, they work through different mechanisms. Both, however, are usually known by their abbreviations:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Short-acting Beta2-agonists (<b>SABA</b>): E.g., <b>Salbutamol</b></li>
            <li>Long-acting Beta2-agonists (<b>LABA</b>): E.g., <b>Salmeterol, Formoterol</b></li>
            <li>Short-acting Muscarinic Antagonists (<b>SAMA</b>): E.g., <b>Ipratropium</b></li>
            <li>Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists (<b>LAMA</b>): E.g., <b>Tiotropium</b></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Beta2-agonists</h3>
        <p>Beta-receptors are a type of <b>adrenergic receptor</b> i.e., receptors that respond to (nor)epinephrine. There are three types of beta-receptors:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Beta1-receptors: Found in the heart and kidneys and have a chrono-, ino- and dromotropic function; in the kidneys, they stimulate renin release</li>
            <li>Beta2-receptors: found in the airways, blood vessels (esp. in skeletal muscle) and gastrointestinal tract; and they cause broncho- and vasodilation and relaxation of smooth muscle in general</li>
            <li>Beta3-receptors: Found in adipose tissue and the bladder; functions to stimulate lipolysis and relax the bladder</li>
        </ol>

        <p>With higher dosages, the "fight-or-flight" system overactives and one might experience <b>tremors, tachycardia, palpitations and a headache</b></p>

        <div class="mnemonic">Imagine being called a <b>beta</b>! You adrenaline would put you in <b>fight mode</b>, so <b>increased cardiovascular function</b>, <b>increased respiratory efficiency</b>, <b>more blood to your muscles</b>, <b>increased energy from fat</b> etc. Basically all the stereotypical sympathetic nervous system function!</div>
        <div class="mnemonic">Most be<b>t</b>a2-agonists end in <b>t</b>erol</div>

        <h3>Muscarinic antagonists</h3>
        <p>From our studies in neurology, we know that there are 3 types of muscarinic receptor subtypes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>M1: Found in the CNS and parasympathetic ganglia, these <b>stimulate</b> cholinergic transmission</li>
            <li>M2: Found in the heart and lungs, these <b>inhibit</b> acetylcholine release via a feedback loop</li>
            <li>M3: Found in smooth muscle and glands, these <b>stimulate</b> bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The SAMA and LAMA classes then <b>selectively block M3</b> in order to decrease stimulation of bronchoconstriction in the airways. There are certain muscarinic antagonists that also block M2, but the net effect is still the reduction of bronchoconstriction.</p>
        <p>SAMAs, especially <b>ipratropium</b> is only used to give quick relief and is often given in combination with longer working beta-agonists. The LAMAs are used to improve baseline lung function and reduce risk of exacerbation.</p>

        <p>They may both give <b>dry mouth</b>, <b>blurred vision</b>, <b>constipation</b>, <b>urinary retention</b> etc.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">Most SA<b>M</b>As and LA<b>M</b>As end in tropiu<b>m</b></div>

        <p>The drug <b>methachoine</b> used in in bronchial challenges for asthma diagnosis does the reverse. It is a <b>selective muscarinic <i>agonist</i></b>!</p>

        <h3>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)</h3>
        <p>Because this class of medication prevents inflammation, it not only <b>improves lung function</b> but also <b>prevents structural airway changes</b>.</p>
        <p>The most commonly used ICS are: <b>Budesonide</b>, <b>Fluticasone</b> and <b>Beclomethasone</b></p>

        <p>Systemic corticosteroids are sometimes given in pulmonology in the context of <b>acute inflammatory disorders</b> and <b>certain interstitial lung diseases</b>!</p>

        <h1>Combination treatment and standard regiments</h1>

        <h2>SABA monotherapy</h2>
        <p>The most common monotherapy to aid quickly with exacerbations is <b>salbutamol</b> also known as <b>Ventolin</b>. Especially for exercise-related asthma, this is often enough.</p>
    
        <h2>SABA/SAMA</h2>
        <p>When the SABA monotherapy does not help enough, one may switch to a SAMA/SABA combination therapy to combat stronger exacerbations. This includes the highly common <b>ipratropium/salbutamol</b> also known as <b>combivent</b>.</p>

        <h2>LAMA/LABA</h2>
        <p>When the exacerbations become too frequent, or when general lung function starts to decline, one may switch to a more sustainable therapy. Only if monotherapy LAMA or LABA doesn't work, one may switch to a combination. One example is a LAMA/LABA such as <b>tiotropium/olodaterol</b> also known as <b>spirolto</b>.</p>
    
        <h2>ICS/LABA</h2>
        <p>When this is still not enough, one may add an ICS. A common example is <b>fromoterol/beclomethason</b> or <b>Foster</b>.</p>

        <h2>Triple therapy</h2>
        <p>A combination of a LAMA/LABA and ICS is the last resort. Here we find options such as <b>beclomethason/formoterol/glycopyrronium</b> or <b>Trimbow</b>.</p>

        <h1>Standard regiments</h1>
        <p>We start with SABA monotherapy, then add a SAMA if monotherapy is not enough. If exacerbations persist, we add a LAMA or LABA. If a single one of those doesn't help with the complaints, we add the other to form a LAMA/LABA duo. If those aren't enough, we may add an ICS in the form of an LABA/ICS. If that is not enough, triple therapy is the last resort. </p>

        <div class="mnemonic">As <b>B</b> comes before <b>M</b>, so the <b>SABA/LABA</b> always comes before <b>SAMA/LAMA</b></div>

        <h1>Other inhaled medication</h1>
        <p>Other types of inhaled medication are commonly used in the context of <b>cystic fibrosis</b>. Such medications include <b>mucolytica</b> and <b>inhaled antibiotics</b>.</p>

        <h2>Mucolytica</h2>
        <p>To thin the mucus that is characteristicly viscous in cystic fibrosis, we may start with <b>inhaled hypertonic saline</b> which draws water into the aiways and thus thins the mucus. Otherwise, there exists the option of <b>dornase alfa</b> which is an enzyme - gotten through genetic mutation - which breaks down the DNA in mucus, thus reducing its viscosity.</p>

        <h2>Inhaled antibiotics</h2>
        <p>As patients with cystic fibrosis often experience pulmonary infections, they might be placed under maintenance therapy. While the most common example is <b>azytromicin per os</b>, another common example is <b>inhaled tobramycin</b>. Note that this is especially useful against the common <b>P. Aeruginosa</b> infections in this patient population.</p>

        <h2>CFTR-modulators</h2>
        <p>Another medication used in cystic fibrosis that is <b>not inhaled</b>, are the CFTR modulators which correct the defective CFTR protein which causes cystic fibrosis. Famous examples are <b>ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor.</b></p>
