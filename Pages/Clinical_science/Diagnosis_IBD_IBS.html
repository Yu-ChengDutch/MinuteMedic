        <h1>IBD</h1>

        <p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) refers to two conditions: <b>M. Crohn</b> and <b>Ulcerative Colitis</b>. They are separated by their pathophysiology and location: M. Crohn affects the <b>small intestine, and large intestine</b> while UC affects the <b>colon and the rectum</b>.</p>

        <p>Shared symptoms include <b>abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, severe internal cramps/muscle spasms, and weight loss</b>. The most common extra-intestinal sign is <b>anaemia</b>.</p>

        <p>Aetiologically, we see that <b>gluten sensitivity</b> is common in IBD (roughly 25%) and a high-protein animal protein and sugar is associated with increased risk of IBD. Similarly, the microbiato may play a large aetiological role. A key role then, is reserved for "increased intestinal permeability" i.e., a breach of intestinal barrier.</p>

        <h2>Crohn's disease</h2>

        <p>M. Crohn is characterised by <b>porridge-like defaecation, sometimes even steathorrhea, commonly with fever, fistulae and weight loss</b>. Tenesmus, a feeling of incomplete defaecation, is <b>not</b> often seen. Anatomically, we see that M. Crohn is associated with the intestines and the anus, showing "skip laesions" (i.e., patchy areas of inflammation), which are <b>transmural</b> and <b>penetrate deep into tissue</b>. Unsurprisingly, <b>stenosis</b> is common.</p>

        <h2>Ulcerative colitis</h2>

        <p>UC is characterised by <b>mucus-like, bloody defaecation, often with tenesmus (feeling of incomplete defaecation)</b>. Fever here, <u>only</u> occurs in severe disease. Seldomly, providing a marked difference with M. Crohn, weight loss, fistulae and fever are seen. Anatomically, it almost always <b>only</b> involves the colon and rectum. Notoriously, there is a higher rate of bile duct involvement in the form of <b>primary sclerosing cholangitis</b>. Inflammation then is <b>superficial</b> and <b>continuous</b>.</p>

        <h1>Diagnosis</h1>

        <p><b>Fecal calprotectin</b>, a marker produced by neutrophils thus indicating migration of them into the intenstinal mucosa and thus of inflammation, is used as a screening tool for IBD but is insufficient for diagnosis. Notably, NSAIDs can easily falsely increase levels of fecal calprotectin.</p>

        <p>Final diagnosis is made using coloscopic biopsy, where inflammation is found.</p>

        <h1>Therapy</h1>

        <p>Therapy then, is primarily medical: <b>Mesalazine</b> has show nuseful for UC. Furthermore, surgically a <b>proctocolectomy</b> can provide solace for UC. Naturally, extra-intestinal symptoms may or may not be cured; and ileostomy will catch faeces. Similarly, in case of M. Crohn we see the use of structureplasties, or even partial bowel resections. Lastly, severe IBD may require immunosuppression using prednisone, TNF-inhibitors, MTX etc.</p>

        <p>Through malabsorption, diarrhea and GI blood loss, nutritional deficiencies are very common. Most commonly, we see deficiencies in <b>B-vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, and key minerals (notably, magnesium, zinc, selenium</b>. For anaemia, <b>parenteral iron</b> might be necessary as inflammations upregulates hepcidin which reduces absorption of intestinal iron. Lastly, pre- and probiotics, as well as faecal transplantations may alleviate symptoms.</p>

        <h1>Complications</h1>

        <p>While disabling, there are very few deadly complications: toxic megacolon and intestinal perforation.</p>

        <h2>Toxic megacolon</h2>

        <p>Most commonly a complication of <b>UC</b> (and not of M. Crohn), toxic megacolon is characterised by a <b>strongly dilated colon and bloating</b>, sometimes accompanied by fever, abdominal pain, and shock. Beyond being caused by IBD, it may also be caused by <b>C. Difficile, E. Histolytica and Shigella or even the use of loperamide</b>.</p>

        <p>Pathophysiologically, it originates by toxins breaking down the protective mucosal barrier, which exposive the <b>muscularis propria</b> (i.e., muscular layer of the intestine), which in turn destroys the <b>colonic nervous system</b>. This results in colonic paralysis, and hence <b>loss of smooth muscle substance, tony and motility</b>. It can be easily visualised on an abdominal radiograph, and is treated by surgical colectomy.</p>

        <h2>Gastrointestinal perforation</h2>

        <p>The ultimate complication, perforation is an indication for an emergent exploratory laparotomy. Therapy usually includes a bowel resection, but regardless, risk of death hovers around 50%. Symptoms include <b>sudden, severe abdominal pain <u>worsened with movement</u>, which starts at site of perforation but spreads quickly</b>. Other symptoms include <b>nausea, hemataemesis, increased heart rate</b> and later <b>fever, or chills</b>.</p>

        <p>When located in the oesophagus (i.e., oesophageal rupture) it is located as <b>Boerhaave syndrome</b>. Sepsis then, is a late stage complication of a rupture. </p>

        <h1>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</h1>

        <p>Probably caused by a disruption of the gut-brain axis, there is a significant overlap between IBS and ME/CFS, fibromyalgia etc. Notably, 5-HT7 (serotonin 7) receptors are over-expressed in IBS, and are implicated in intestinal hyperalgesia. However, the microbiota seems to play a role, as SIBO also more commonly occurs in IBS patients.</p>

        <p>Diagnosis is made <i>per exclusionem</i>, and requires a full work-up: hydrogen breath test, stool microscopy, blood tests, ultrasound and endoscopy. No alarm symptoms (e.g., late onset, weight loss, blood in stool, iron-deficiency anaemia, IBD, caeliac, or a family history of colon cancer) may be present. The Rome IV criteria are then used for diagnosis:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>IBS-C (predominant constipation): <b>>25%</b> of bowel movements BSS 1 or 2 and <b>less than 25%</b> of bowel movements BSS 6 or 7</li>
            <li>IBS-D (predominant diarrhea): <b>>25%</b> of bowel movements BSS 6 or 7 and <b>less than 25%</b> of bowel movements BSS 1 or 2</li>
            <li>IBS-M (mixed): >25% diarrhee (6,7), and >25% constipation (1, 2)</li>
