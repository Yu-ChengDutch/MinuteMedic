        <h1>Introduction and Concepts</h1>
        <p>An <b>intoxication</b> (or poisoning) is defined as a pathological condition resulting from an excessive
            amount of a particular compound in the body. This occurs when the concentration of the compound at the
            receptor or organ level is higher than therapeutically intended. This definition highlights the distinction
            between an intoxication and a side effect or an allergic reaction. When administering medication, the aim is
            to achieve a desired plasma or serum concentration for a therapeutic effect.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>For urgent questions regarding intoxications, healthcare professionals can contact the <b>Nationaal
                Vergiftingen Informatie Centrum (NVIC)</b> by phone at <b>0887558000</b>, which is available 24 hours a
            day.</p>

        <h2>Chronic Intoxication</h2>
        <p>A <b>chronic intoxication</b> is defined as <b>repeated exposure over a longer period that exceeds the body's
                elimination capacity</b>. The causes of elevated concentrations in the body can be diverse. In cases of
            drug intoxications where an immediate high dose intake is not apparent, potential <b>organ function
                disorders</b> (affecting biotransformation and/or elimination), <b>drug interactions</b>, or <b>genetic
                inter-individual variations</b> should be considered. Generally, these intoxications develop slowly.</p>

        <h2>Acute Poisoning</h2>
        <p>
            An <b>acute poisoning</b> typically results from an overdose. It is characterized by <b>short-term exposure
                to a large quantity and/or high concentration of a drug or compound</b>, often occurring once or a few
            times within a 24-hour period. The resulting elevated concentrations and the onset of symptoms are
            considered a drug intoxication.
            <br><br>
            It is crucial to know if the patient is a chronic user of the medication involved. For chronic users, tissue
            concentrations are higher, meaning an additional acute overdose can alter the course and clinical picture
            compared to a single acute overdose in a non-user.
            <br><br>
            Acute poisonings are categorized into:
            <br> - <b>Accidental</b> (per ongeluk) intoxications.
            <br> - <b>Intentional</b> (opzettelijke) intoxications.
            <br><br>
            <b>Accidental auto-intoxications</b> in young children are often caused by their exploratory behavior
            involving hand-mouth contact. The majority of these cases involve medications readily available at home that
            are not safely stored, such as those in a visitor's handbag.
            <br><br>
            Both children and adults can experience accidental intoxications due to <b>medication errors</b>, which
            include mistakes in prescribing, dispensing, or administering a drug. In children, this often involves
            parents/caregivers mistakenly giving too high a dose or the wrong medication.
            <br><br>
            <b>Intentional auto-intoxications</b> primarily occur in adults, often involving their own medication. For
            children aged around 10 years and older, the number of accidental poisonings decreases significantly, with
            intentional poisonings by the child themselves becoming more common.
            <br><br>
            Intentional poisonings inflicted by another person also occur but are not always recognized immediately. A
            specific form in children is <b>Münchhausen-by-proxy syndrome</b>, where a child is poisoned, usually by the
            mother, and then presented to the medical circuit with supposedly unexplained symptoms and misleading
            information.
            <br><br>
            The <b>route of exposure</b> is important for a correct risk assessment of the severity of the intoxication.
            For medications, ingestion is common in both children and adults. Overdoses can also occur via other routes
            like rectal, sublingual, intramuscular (e.g., with IM depot preparations), and intravenous (sometimes with
            extravasation). Errors in administration routes (e.g., nebulizer fluid given intravenously, eye drops
            ingested) can also lead to intoxication. When drugs are in solution, the solvent itself can also contribute
            to the intoxication.

        <h1>Toxicokinetics versus Pharmacokinetics</h1>
        <p>
            In an overdose situation, the pharmacokinetics of many drugs differ from therapeutic administration.
            Comprehensive toxicokinetic data regarding absorption, distribution, biotransformation, and elimination
            during overdose are relatively scarce, mostly derived from human overdose case studies or animal
            experiments. When these processes behave differently, it affects the clinical picture. The
            <b>toxicodynamics</b> (effects of the drug on the body in overdose) also differ from pharmacodynamics. In
            overdose, the specificity for certain receptors is often significantly reduced; for example, a drug with
            little anticholinergic activity at therapeutic doses can exhibit strong anticholinergic effects in overdose.
            <br><br>
            Several specific points of attention include:
            <br> - <b>Absorption:</b> The rate of absorption can decrease during an overdose, leading to delayed peak
            plasma or serum concentrations compared to therapeutic doses. Effects may last longer, especially with
            sustained-release medications. Prolonged absorption can be due to the larger quantity of drug in the
            gastrointestinal tract or specific properties of the drug, such as reduced gastrointestinal motility due to
            parasympathicolytic properties. In severe intoxications with gastrointestinal paralysis, a renewed
            intoxication can treacherously occur upon patient recovery and return of peristalsis, as remaining drug in
            the intestine is reabsorbed. This necessitates longer use of absorption-reducing measures and repeated
            administration of activated charcoal when peristalsis resumes.
            <br> - <b>Distribution:</b> Drug distribution can be affected by a decrease in the protein-bound fraction,
            leading to a larger free fraction and a more severe clinical picture. Disturbances in acid-base balance due
            to intoxication can also alter the free fraction.
            <br> - <b>Biotransformation and Elimination:</b> Most drugs undergo biotransformation in the liver. Liver
            dysfunction can alter the rate of biotransformation, though the liver's capacity is generally high,
            requiring severe impairment for significant consequences. Pre-existing liver conditions are relevant.
            Saturation of enzyme systems can lead to delayed metabolism, potentially resulting in a different clinical
            picture and time course than with therapeutic dosing, depending on the formation of active and toxic
            metabolites. Sometimes, the preferred metabolic pathway becomes saturated, and an alternative pathway (with
            different metabolites) becomes more important in overdose. Depletion of conjugating compounds can delay
            elimination. Metabolites can be toxic and have longer elimination half-lives than the original compound,
            which becomes more pronounced in overdose. Good kidney function is also vital for the ultimate elimination
            of many compounds, and this too can be impaired by the nature of the intoxication itself.
        </p>

        <h1>Treatment of the Poisoned Patient</h1>
        <p>
            General guidelines for patient assessment:
            <br> - Be aware that the (hetero)anamnesis (patient history from patient or others) can be very unreliable,
            especially in intentional auto-intoxications in adults. For children "snacking from pots," the ingested
            amount is often completely unclear.
            <br> - Map out the <b>circumstances of exposure</b>, such as whether it was an overdose of own medication,
            the administration route, influence on first-pass effect if the route was wrong, and time of overdose.
            <br> - Map out the <b>medical history</b>, including any relevant pre-existing conditions.
            <br> - <b>Assess and stabilize vital functions</b> as the first crucial step. Standard acute disease
            diagnostic procedures apply to poisoned patients. Besides respiration, consciousness, and circulation,
            abnormalities in body temperature (hypo- or hyperthermia) and pupil size (miosis or mydriasis) are important
            for rapid patient assessment.
            <br> - <b>Record the time course of all symptoms</b>, as poisoning is a dynamic process requiring careful
            and repeated physical examination. Clinical presentation can vary over time from asymptomatic to severely
            ill. Even if the exact onset time of symptoms is unclear, their progression in terms of nature, sequence,
            and severity over time can indicate the causative agent.
            <br> - Constantly question whether a symptom is <b>primarily caused by the intoxicating substance or by a
                secondary complication</b> (e.g., a fall with injury due to primary decreased consciousness from
            intoxication). All organ systems can be involved, leading to a wide variety of symptoms.
            <br> - Pay attention to <b>symmetry</b>: systemic effects of poisonings manifest symmetrically. One-sided
            weakness or an abnormal pupil size in one eye, in the absence of pre-existing pathology, makes intoxication
            much less likely.
            <br> - Check for a <b>complex of symptoms forming a syndrome, called a toxidrome</b>. A toxidrome can
            indicate the cause of intoxication. However, if multiple substances are involved, a 'classic' toxidrome may
            be absent.

        </p>

        <h2>Toelichting bij het raadplegen van het Nationaal Vergiftingen Informatie Centrum</h2>
        <p>
            When consulting the <b>National Poison Information Center (NVIC)</b> for advice and severity calculation,
            note the following information about the drug:
            <br> - Name
            <br> - Strength
            <br> - Quantity or concentration ingested (or an estimate)
            <br> - And the patient's (estimated) body weight in kg
            <br><br>
            The NVIC provides <b>doctors and other healthcare professionals</b> with information on possible health
            effects and treatment of acute poisonings. It is part of the Vital Functions Division of UMC Utrecht and can
            be reached via its <b>24-hour information telephone (0887558000)</b> and its website, vergiftigingen.info.
            Professional healthcare providers can independently access toxicological information via the website, which
            is compiled by the NVIC and stored in an advanced digital database.
            <br><br>
            <b>Important:</b> If a medication is not found on the website, consult the NVIC by phone. Not all
            medications are included in the database, especially those less frequently consulted but for which
            information is available from other sources. When using the 24-hour phone service, doctors speak with an
            NVIC employee specialized in clinical toxicology, with further consultation with NVIC medical specialists
            available if needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Severity Assessment by NVIC</h2>
        <p>
            Whether exposure to a drug leads to poisoning symptoms depends on the dose; a low dose may not cause any. If
            symptoms occur, they can be local or systemic:
            <br> - <b>Local effects</b> arise at the site of first contact with the substance.
            <br> - <b>Systemic effects</b> appear after the compound is absorbed into the body.
            <br><br>
            When consulting the NVIC, an estimation of the possible severity of the poisoning is made <b>based on the
                ingested amount of medication and the patient's body weight</b>. The NVIC-database calculates the
            <b>systemic dose</b> (in mg drug per kg body weight) and compares it with toxicity threshold values.
            <br><br>
            The severity is classified into categories:
            <br> - <b>'Niet' (Not)</b>
            <br> - <b>'Licht' (Light)</b>
            <br> - <b>'Matig' (Moderate)</b>
            <br> - <b>'Ernstig' (Severe)</b>
            <br> - <b>'Worst Case'</b>
            <br><br>
            For a <b>light intoxication</b>, generally no treatment is needed, as symptoms are mild and resolve on their
            own. For <b>moderate or severe poisoning</b>, symptoms require treatment, and the patient is usually
            referred to a hospital for observation and treatment.
            <br><br>
            The <b>'Worst Case'</b> classification is used when the ingested dose is unknown or when the exposure route
            is other than ingestion, as other aspects must then be evaluated (e.g., whether the substance is absorbed
            via the relevant route).
            <br><br>
            Based on this severity classification, the database lists expected symptoms for the calculated severity
            level and suggests diagnostic and treatment options. <b>Crucially, regardless of the NVIC's estimated
                severity, a critical assessment of the individual patient is always necessary</b> to determine if other
            relevant factors influence the clinical picture or if hospital admission is warranted for the patient's
            overall condition.
