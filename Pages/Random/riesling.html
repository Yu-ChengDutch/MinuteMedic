        <h1>History of Riesling</h1>
        <h2>Ancient History</h2>
        <p><b>Riesling</b> is one of the oldest cultivated grape varieties, with its origins tracing back to the <b>Rhine region</b> in modern-day Germany. While there is no definitive proof of Riesling in antiquity, some historians speculate that the <b>Roman Empire</b> may have cultivated early ancestors of the grape. The first written mention of "Rüssling" appears in a 1435 document from the <b>Count of Katzenelnbogen</b>, a key figure in medieval viticulture.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Modern History (Medieval & Renaissance)</h2>
        <p>During the <b>Middle Ages</b>, monasteries played a crucial role in preserving and refining Riesling cultivation. The <b>Cistercian monks</b> of the Rhine and Mosel regions were particularly influential, perfecting vineyard sites that are still renowned today. By the <b>Renaissance</b>, Riesling had gained prominence in Germany, with plantings expanding along steep riverbanks. The grape was prized for its <b>ability to reflect terroir</b> and its resistance to cold climates.</p>

        <h2>Modern History</h2>
        <p>The <b>19th century</b> marked Riesling's golden age, particularly in Germany, where it was considered superior to even <b>Bordeaux and Burgundy wines</b>. The <b>Prussian classification system</b> of 1868 formally recognized top Riesling vineyards, many of which remain prestigious today. However, the <b>20th century</b> saw a decline due to world wars and industrial winemaking trends. A resurgence began in the <b>1980s</b>, as dry Riesling styles gained international acclaim.</p>

        <h1>Production of Riesling</h1>
        <h2>Agriculture: Historical vs. Modern</h2>
        <p>Historically, Riesling was grown on <b>steep, slate-rich slopes</b> to maximize sun exposure in cooler climates. Vineyards were often terraced by hand, a labor-intensive process. Today, while some traditional methods persist, modern viticulture employs <b>precision farming</b>, including soil sensors and drone monitoring, to optimize ripeness and acidity balance.</p>

        <h2>Winemaking Techniques</h2>
        <p>Riesling is typically <b>cold-fermented</b> in stainless steel or neutral oak to preserve its delicate aromatics. Some producers use <b>wild yeast</b> for complexity. The grape’s high natural acidity allows for versatile styles: <b>dry (Trocken), off-dry (Halbtrocken), sweet (Spätlese, Auslese), and botrytized (Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese)</b>.</p>

        <h2>Ageing Potential</h2>
        <p>High-quality Riesling can age for <b>decades</b>, developing <b>petrol-like notes</b> (from TDN compound) and honeyed complexity. Sweet Rieslings, in particular, gain depth over time due to their sugar and acid structure.</p>

        <h1>Growth and Terroir</h1>
        <h2>Key Regions</h2>
        <p><b>Germany</b> (Mosel, Rheingau, Pfalz) remains the benchmark, with <b>Mosel’s slate soils</b> producing razor-sharp acidity and floral notes. <b>Alsace, France</b> yields fuller-bodied, dry Rieslings with higher alcohol. <b>Austria’s Wachau</b> region is known for mineral-driven, steely styles. New World regions like <b>Australia’s Clare Valley</b> (lime/zest) and <b>New York’s Finger Lakes</b> (high acid, lean profile) have also gained acclaim.</p>

        <h2>Terroir Influence</h2>
        <p><b>Slate</b> imparts flinty minerality, <b>limestone</b> adds texture, and <b>sandstone</b> yields softer wines. Cool climates emphasize green apple/citrus, while warmer sites show peach/apricot.</p>

        <h1>Taste and Flavor</h1>
        <h2>Chemical Composition</h2>
        <p>Riesling’s high <b>tartaric acid</b> gives it backbone, while <b>terpenes</b> (like linalool) create floral aromas. <b>TDN</b> emerges with age, adding petrol notes.</p>

        <h2>Flavor Profiles</h2>
        <p><b>Young Riesling</b>: Lime, green apple, jasmine. <b>Aged Riesling</b>: Honey, petrol, dried apricot. <b>Sweet Riesling</b>: Candied citrus, tropical fruit.</p>
