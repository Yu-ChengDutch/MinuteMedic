        <h1>Introduction to White Wines</h1>
        <p>The world of <b>white wines</b> represents one of the most diverse and historically significant categories in viticulture, with a lineage stretching back over 8,000 years. Unlike their red counterparts, white wines are typically produced from <b>green-skinned grapes</b>, though they can also be made from <b>black-skinned grapes</b> when the juice is separated quickly from the skins. The fundamental distinction lies in the <b>absence of prolonged skin contact</b> during fermentation, which preserves the wine's lighter color and often more delicate flavor profile.</p>
        
        <h2>Anatomy of White Wine Production</h2>
        <p>The production of white wine involves several critical physiological and biochemical processes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Harvesting:</b> Grapes are picked at optimal ripeness, when sugar (brix), acid, and flavor compounds (terpenes, thiols) are in balance.</li>
            <li><b>Crushing/Destemming:</b> Grapes are gently crushed to release juice while minimizing skin contact and tannin extraction.</li>
            <li><b>Pressing:</b> The must (juice, skins, seeds) is pressed to separate liquid from solids.</li>
            <li><b>Clarification:</b> Solids are removed through settling, centrifugation, or filtration.</li>
            <li><b>Fermentation:</b> Yeast converts sugars to alcohol, typically at cooler temperatures (12-22°C) to preserve delicate aromas.</li>
            <li><b>Aging:</b> Wine may be aged in stainless steel (for freshness) or oak (for complexity).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Historical Timeline</h2>
        <p>The history of white wine production can be traced through several key epochs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Ancient Origins (6000-3000 BCE):</b> Earliest evidence from Georgia and Iran, using qvevri (clay vessels) for fermentation.</li>
            <li><b>Classical Period (800 BCE-400 CE):</b> Greek and Roman expansion spread viticulture throughout Europe.</li>
            <li><b>Medieval Development (500-1400 CE):</b> Monasteries perfected white wine techniques, especially in Germany and France.</li>
            <li><b>Modern Era (1800-present):</b> Scientific understanding of fermentation and refrigeration revolutionized white wine production.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Major White Wine Varietals</h1>
        <p>The world of white wines encompasses hundreds of distinct grape varieties, each with unique characteristics shaped by <b>terroir</b> (the complete natural environment) and <b>winemaking techniques</b>. Understanding these varietals requires examining their flavor profiles, ideal growing conditions, and historical significance.</p>
        
        <h2>Chardonnay</h2>
        <p>The <b>Chardonnay</b> grape is perhaps the most versatile and widely planted white varietal, capable of producing styles ranging from lean and mineral-driven to rich and buttery. Its <b>physiological characteristics</b> include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Early budding:</b> Makes it susceptible to spring frosts</li>
            <li><b>Thin skins:</b> Results in lower tannin content</li>
            <li><b>Neutral flavor profile:</b> Highly influenced by terroir and winemaking</li>

        <h1>White Wine Production Techniques</h1>
        <p>The sensory profile of white wines is profoundly influenced by <b>winemaking decisions</b> at each stage of production. These techniques represent the intersection of tradition and modern technology in oenology.</p>
        
        <h2>Fermentation Vessel Selection</h2>
        <p>The choice of fermentation vessel impacts oxygen exposure, temperature control, and flavor extraction:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Stainless steel:</b> Preserves primary fruit aromas, allows precise temperature control</li>
            <li><b>Oak barrels:</b> Adds vanilla, spice notes; allows micro-oxygenation</li>

        <h1>Terroir and White Wine Expression</h1>
        <p>The concept of <b>terroir</b>—the complete natural environment where grapes are grown—plays a particularly crucial role in white wines, where subtle variations in soil and climate can dramatically affect flavor profiles.</p>
        
        <h2>Soil Composition</h2>
        <p>Different soil types influence vine stress, mineral uptake, and heat retention:</p>
        <ol>

            <li><b>Slate:</b> Retains heat, contributes flinty notes (Mosel Riesling)</li>
            <li><b>Volcanic:</b> Imparts smoky, salty characteristics (Santorini Assyrtiko)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Climate Effects</h2>
        <p>Temperature and sunlight exposure affect acid retention and flavor development:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cool climate:</b> Higher acidity, greener flavors (gooseberry, grass)</li>
            <li><b>Moderate climate:</b> Balanced acidity, stone fruit flavors</li>
            <li><b>Warm climate:</b> Lower acidity, tropical fruit flavors</li>
