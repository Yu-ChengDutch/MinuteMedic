        <h1>Introduction to Viognier</h1>
        <p><strong>Viognier</strong> is a white wine grape variety known for its aromatic intensity, lush texture, and complex flavor profile. Once nearly extinct, it has experienced a resurgence in popularity due to its unique characteristics and versatility in both single-varietal wines and blends.</p>

        <h2>History of Viognier</h2>
        <h3>Ancient History</h3>
        <p>The origins of <strong>Viognier</strong> are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed to have been brought to the Rhône region by the Romans around 281 AD. Some theories suggest it may have originated in Dalmatia (modern-day Croatia), though genetic studies remain inconclusive.</p>
        
        <h3>Pre-Modern History (Medieval & Renaissance)</h3>
        <p>During the Middle Ages, Viognier was cultivated in the <strong>Condrieu</strong> and <strong>Château-Grillet</strong> appellations of the Northern Rhône. Its production was limited due to its low yields and susceptibility to disease. By the Renaissance, it was considered a noble grape, prized for its aromatic qualities.</p>
        
        <h3>Modern History</h3>
        <p>By the 20th century, Viognier was nearly extinct, with only about <strong>30 acres</strong> remaining in Condrieu by the 1960s. Its revival began in the 1980s when New World winemakers (particularly in California and Australia) recognized its potential. Today, it is planted globally, from France to South Africa.</p>

    <!-- PRODUCTION SECTION -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>Production of Viognier</h2>
        <h3>Agriculture: Historical vs. Modern</h3>
        <p>Historically, Viognier was grown on steep, granite slopes in the Rhône, requiring manual labor due to its <strong>low vigor</strong> and <strong>susceptibility to powdery mildew</strong>. Modern viticulture employs careful canopy management and selective clonal breeding to improve yield and disease resistance.</p>
        
        <h3>Winemaking Process</h3>
        <p>Viognier is typically <strong>whole-cluster pressed</strong> to avoid bitterness from skins. Fermentation occurs in stainless steel (for freshness) or oak (for richness). Some producers use <strong>wild yeast</strong> for complexity. Malolactic fermentation is often avoided to preserve acidity.</p>
        
        <h3>Ageing</h3>
        <p>Viognier can be aged in <strong>neutral oak, concrete eggs, or stainless steel</strong>. Extended lees contact adds creaminess. Unlike Chardonnay, it rarely benefits from long oak ageing, as its delicate aromas can be overwhelmed.</p>
        
        <div class="mnemonic">
            <p><strong>Mnemonic: "Fresh or Fat Viognier"</strong> – Stainless steel keeps it <strong>fresh</strong>, while oak makes it <strong>fat</strong> (richer).</p>

        <h2>Growth and Terroir of Viognier</h2>
        <h3>Key Regions</h3>
        <p><strong>France (Rhône):</strong> Condrieu and Château-Grillet are the classic appellations, producing intensely floral wines. <strong>Languedoc</strong> makes more affordable, fruit-driven styles. <strong>New World:</strong> California (Central Coast), Australia (Yarra Valley), and South Africa (Stellenbosch) excel with riper expressions.</p>
        
        <h3>Terroir Influence</h3>
        <p><strong>Granite soils</strong> (Condrieu) produce wines with mineral precision, while <strong>clay-limestone</strong> (Languedoc) yields rounder textures. Warmer climates (California) emphasize tropical fruit, whereas cooler sites (Virginia) retain acidity and floral notes.</p>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h2>Taste and Flavor Profile</h2>

        <p>Viognier’s signature aromas come from <strong>terpenes</strong> (also found in Muscat) and <strong>C13-norisoprenoids</strong>, which create floral (violets, orange blossom) and stone fruit (apricot, peach) notes. Low acidity (pH ~3.6) contributes to its plush mouthfeel.</p>
        
        <h3>Wine Descriptions</h3>
        <p><strong>Young Viognier:</strong> Explosive aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle, and ripe pear. <strong>Aged Viognier:</strong> Develops honey, ginger, and toasted almond nuances. Overripe examples can show <strong>sherried</strong> notes.</p>
