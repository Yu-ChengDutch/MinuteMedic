        <h1>Introduction to Pinot Grigio</h1>
        <p><strong>Pinot Grigio</strong>, also known as <strong>Pinot Gris</strong>, is a white wine grape variety that produces crisp, refreshing wines with a wide range of styles, from light and zesty to rich and complex. Its popularity stems from its versatility, approachability, and ability to reflect terroir distinctly. This chapter explores its history, production, terroir, branding, taste, and food pairings in exhaustive detail.</p>

    <!-- HISTORY SECTION -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>History of Pinot Grigio</h1>
        <h2>Ancient History</h2>
        <p><strong>Pinot Grigio's origins</strong> trace back to the <strong>Burgundy region of France</strong>, where it is believed to be a <strong>mutation of Pinot Noir</strong>. The first recorded mention dates to the <strong>Middle Ages</strong>, though genetic studies suggest it may have existed as early as the Roman era. The grape's name, "Gris" (French for "gray"), refers to its distinctive <strong>pinkish-gray skin</strong>, a trait inherited from its parent variety.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Modern History (Medieval & Renaissance)</h2>
        <p>During the <strong>14th century</strong>, Pinot Gris gained prominence in <strong>Burgundy</strong> and later spread to <strong>Switzerland and Germany</strong>. By the <strong>Renaissance</strong>, it was cultivated in the <strong>Alsace region</strong>, where it developed a richer, more aromatic profile. Monastic vineyards played a crucial role in preserving and refining its cultivation techniques.</p>

        <h2>Modern History</h2>
        <p>In the <strong>18th and 19th centuries</strong>, Pinot Gris was introduced to <strong>Northern Italy</strong>, where it became known as <strong>Pinot Grigio</strong>. The Italian style—lighter, crisper, and more acidic—contrasted with the fuller-bodied Alsatian version. In the <strong>20th century</strong>, <strong>California and Oregon</strong> began producing Pinot Grigio, further diversifying its global presence.</p>

    <!-- PRODUCTION SECTION -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Production of Pinot Grigio</h1>
        <h2>Agriculture: Historical vs. Modern</h2>
        <p><strong>Historically</strong>, Pinot Grigio was grown in <strong>mixed vineyards</strong> alongside other Pinot varieties, leading to field blends. Modern viticulture emphasizes <strong>clonal selection</strong> to enhance consistency. The grape thrives in <strong>cool climates</strong> with well-drained soils, though it adapts to warmer regions with careful canopy management.</p>

        <h2>Winemaking Process</h2>
        <p>Pinot Grigio is typically <strong>harvested early</strong> to retain acidity. After crushing, the juice is <strong>fermented in stainless steel tanks</strong> at controlled temperatures to preserve freshness. Some premium producers use <strong>partial oak aging</strong> or <strong>lees stirring</strong> (bâtonnage) for texture.</p>

        <h2>Ageing Potential</h2>
        <p>Most Pinot Grigios are <strong>meant for early consumption</strong>, but high-quality examples from <strong>Alsace or Alto Adige</strong> can age for <strong>5–10 years</strong>, developing honeyed and nutty nuances.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">
            <p><strong>Mnemonic: "STEEL vs. OAK"</strong> – Remember that most Pinot Grigio is fermented in <strong>stainless steel</strong> (for crispness), while richer styles may use <strong>oak</strong> (for complexity).</p>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 3</h1>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Growth and Terroir</h1>
        <h2>Key Regions</h2>
        <p><strong>Italy</strong> (Veneto, Friuli, Alto Adige) produces <strong>light, citrus-driven</strong> styles. <strong>Alsace, France</strong>, yields <strong>fuller, spicier</strong> wines, often with residual sugar. <strong>Oregon and California</strong> make <strong>medium-bodied</strong> versions with ripe stone fruit notes.</p>

        <h2>Terroir Influence</h2>
        <p><strong>Cool climates</strong> (Alto Adige) emphasize <strong>green apple and lime</strong>, while <strong>warmer regions</strong> (California) favor <strong>peach and melon</strong>. Volcanic soils (Soave, Italy) add <strong>minerality</strong>, whereas limestone (Alsace) enhances <strong>complexity</strong>.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">
            <p><strong>Mnemonic: "CLIMATE = CRISP or CREAMY"</strong> – Cool climates make <strong>crisp</strong> Pinot Grigio; warm climates make <strong>creamy</strong> styles.</p>
