        <h1>Introduction to Puberty</h1>
        <p><b>Puberty</b> is a complex developmental process marked by the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to physical, hormonal, and psychological changes that transition an individual from childhood into reproductive adulthood. The process is tightly regulated by genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors, with significant variability in onset and progression among individuals.</p>
        
        <h2>Anatomy and Physiology of the HPG Axis</h2>
        <p>The <b>hypothalamus</b> secretes <b>gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)</b> in a pulsatile manner, stimulating the anterior pituitary to release <b>luteinizing hormone (LH)</b> and <b>follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</b>. These gonadotropins act on the gonads (ovaries in females, testes in males), promoting sex steroid production (<b>estradiol</b> and <b>testosterone</b>) and gametogenesis. Negative feedback mechanisms modulate this axis, with sex steroids inhibiting GnRH secretion in childhood until central inhibition is lifted at puberty.</p>

        <h2>Historical Perspective</h2>
        <p>The scientific understanding of puberty evolved significantly in the 20th century with the discovery of GnRH and the role of kisspeptin neurons in initiating puberty. The <b>Tanner stages</b>, developed by James Tanner in 1969, remain the gold standard for assessing pubertal progression.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Hormonal Changes</h2>
        <p>Before puberty, <b>minimal LH/FSH secretion</b> occurs due to central suppression. At puberty, <b>kisspeptin neurons</b> activate GnRH secretion, leading to nocturnal LH pulses that later become diurnal. <b>Adrenarche</b>, the maturation of the adrenal zona reticularis, occurs independently, producing <b>dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)</b>, which contributes to pubic/axillary hair growth (<b>pubarche</b>).</p>

        <h1>Tanner Stages of Pubertal Development</h1>
        <p>The <b>Tanner stages</b> (I–V) classify pubertal progression based on breast/genital development and pubic hair growth. <b>Stage I</b> is pre-pubertal, while <b>Stage V</b> signifies adult maturity.</p>
        
        <h2>Females</h2>
        <p><b>Thelarche</b> (breast budding, Tanner II) is typically the first sign, occurring at ~10–11 years. <b>Menarche</b> (first menstruation) occurs ~2–3 years after thelarche, usually at Tanner IV. Pubic hair progresses from sparse (Tanner II) to adult distribution (Tanner V).</p>

        <h2>Males</h2>
        <p><b>Testicular enlargement</b> (>4 mL volume or >2.5 cm length, Tanner II) is the earliest sign, occurring at ~11–12 years. Penile growth and pubic hair follow, with adult distribution reached at Tanner V.</p>

        <h1>Early Puberty: Pubertas Praecox</h1>
        <p><b>Pubertas praecox</b> (precocious puberty) is defined as pubertal onset before <b>8 years in females</b> and <b>9 years in males</b>. It is classified as <b>central (GnRH-dependent)</b> or <b>peripheral (GnRH-independent)</b>.</p>
        
        <h2>Central Precocious Puberty (CPP)</h2>
        <p><b>Aetiology:</b> CPP results from premature HPG axis activation. Causes include <b>idiopathic (most common in females)</b>, CNS lesions (e.g., hypothalamic hamartoma, glioma), or genetic mutations (e.g., <i>MKRN3</i> loss-of-function).</p>
        <p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Early GnRH pulsatility leads to LH/FSH-driven gonadal maturation. Growth acceleration occurs initially, but premature epiphyseal fusion may result in <b>short adult stature</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Diagnosis:</b> Elevated LH/FSH on GnRH stimulation test, advanced bone age, and pubertal sex steroids. MRI brain is mandatory to exclude CNS pathology.</p>
        <p><b>Treatment:</b> <b>GnRH agonists</b> (e.g., leuprolide) suppress the HPG axis, halting progression and preserving height potential.</p>
        
        <h2>Peripheral Precocious Puberty (PPP)</h2>
        <p><b>Aetiology:</b> PPP is caused by <b>autonomous sex steroid secretion</b>, e.g., ovarian cysts, testicular tumors, adrenal disorders (congenital adrenal hyperplasia), or McCune-Albright syndrome.</p>
        <p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Sex steroids are produced independently of LH/FSH, leading to pubertal changes without HPG axis activation. <b>Testicular enlargement is absent in males</b> unless due to hCG-secreting tumors.</p>
        <p><b>Diagnosis:</b> Suppressed LH/FSH, elevated sex steroids, and abnormal imaging (e.g., adrenal CT).</p>
        <p><b>Treatment:</b> Address the underlying cause (e.g., tumor resection, glucocorticoids for CAH).</p>
        
        <div class="mnemonic">
            <p><b>Mnemonic: "Central Puberty is GnRH-High"</b> – CPP shows high LH/FSH on GnRH stimulation, while PPP shows low LH/FSH.</p>

        <h1>Late Puberty: Hypogonadism</h1>
        <p><b>Delayed puberty</b> is defined as absence of pubertal signs by <b>13 years in females</b> or <b>14 years in males</b>. It is classified as <b>hypogonadotropic</b> (low LH/FSH) or <b>hypergonadotropic</b> (high LH/FSH).</p>
        
        <h2>Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (HH)</h2>
        <p><b>Aetiology:</b> HH results from <b>HPG axis suppression</b>. Causes include constitutional delay (most common), chronic illness (e.g., Crohn’s), CNS tumors (e.g., craniopharyngioma), or genetic disorders (e.g., Kallmann syndrome).</p>
        <p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Absent GnRH/LH/FSH secretion leads to deficient sex steroids. Bone age is typically delayed.</p>
        <p><b>Diagnosis:</b> Low LH/FSH and sex steroids. MRI brain is indicated if HH is isolated or with anosmia (Kallmann syndrome).</p>
        <p><b>Treatment:</b> <b>Testosterone</b> (males) or <b>estradiol</b> (females) for induction. GnRH pumps may be used for fertility.</p>
        
        <h2>Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism</h2>
        <p><b>Aetiology:</b> Primary gonadal failure due to <b>Turner syndrome</b> (45,X), <b>Klinefelter syndrome</b> (47,XXY), or gonadal dysgenesis.</p>
        <p><b>Pathophysiology:</b> Gonadal insufficiency leads to <b>loss of negative feedback</b>, elevating LH/FSH. Streak gonads (Turner) or small testes (Klinefelter) are typical.</p>
        <p><b>Diagnosis:</b> Elevated LH/FSH, low sex steroids, and karyotyping. Pelvic ultrasound (Turner) or testicular biopsy (Klinefelter) may be needed.</p>
        <p><b>Treatment:</b> Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and fertility counseling.</p>
