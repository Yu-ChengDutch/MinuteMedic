        <h1>Introduction to Childhood Development</h1>
        <p><b>Childhood development</b> is a dynamic, multidimensional process encompassing physical, cognitive, linguistic, and socioemotional growth from birth through adolescence. Understanding developmental milestones is critical for pediatricians to identify delays, assess well-being, and guide parental expectations.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The systematic study of child development began in the early 20th century with pioneers like <b>Jean Piaget</b> (cognitive stages), <b>Erik Erikson</b> (psychosocial stages), and <b>Lev Vygotsky</b> (social learning). Their work established that development occurs in predictable sequences, though timing varies individually.</p>
        
        <h2>Neurobiological Foundations</h2>
        <p>The <b>central nervous system (CNS)</b> undergoes rapid maturation during childhood:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Myelination</b>: Proceeds cephalocaudally, completing by age 2 years for major tracts but continuing into adolescence for prefrontal areas.</li>
            <li><b>Synaptogenesis</b>: Peaks at 2-3 years, followed by pruning to refine neural networks.</li>
            <li><b>Plasticity</b>: Young brains exhibit remarkable adaptability, allowing recovery from injury but also vulnerability to environmental deprivation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="mnemonic">
            <b>Mnemonic: "Myelin Makes Speedy Signals"</b> - Myelination enables faster neural transmission, correlating with motor and cognitive skill acquisition.

        <h1>Newborn to 1 Month: Neonatal Adaptations</h1>
        
        <h2>Physical Development</h2>
        <p><b>Primitive reflexes</b> dominate motor function: Moro, rooting, palmar grasp, and asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR). <b>Posture</b> is flexed due to physiological hypertonia. <b>Vision</b> is limited to 8-12 inches (face recognition distance) with preference for high-contrast patterns.</p>
        
        <h2>Cognitive/Linguistic</h2>
        <p><b>Habituation</b> to repeated stimuli demonstrates early learning. Vocalizations are limited to crying, but infants show preference for human speech (especially maternal voice) and can discriminate phonetic contrasts from all languages.</p>
        
        <h2>Social-Emotional</h2>
        <p><b>Attachment behaviors</b> emerge through mutual gaze ("eye-to-eye love") and calming to a caregiver's voice. The <b>still-face paradigm</b> experiments show infants' expectation of social reciprocity.</p>

    <!-- 2-6 MONTHS -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>2-9 Months: Sensorimotor Exploration</h1>
        
        <h2>2 months</h2>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>At this age, children are usually able to <b>hold head up in a prone position</b>, as well as utilise/move all limbs. Hands can open, but usually only briefly.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic development</h3>
        <p>This is the age at which <b>eye tracking starts</b> and toys may be looked at for several seconds. You can also start to hear the first non-crying sounds, and loud sounds will get a reaction.</p>
        <h3>Social-emotional</h3>
        <p>Picking the baby up will have a calming effect, and faces become <b>a point of interest</b>. Smiling becomes social (i.e., smiles when you come towards them or talk to them).</p>
    
        <h2>4 months</h2>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>At this age, head is steady even when <b>being held</b>; and whereas the hands used to only be able to open briefly, the baby is now able to <b>hold a toy when given one</b>. The arms then, are used to reach for/swing at toys, and to bring hands to mouth. When prone, the baby is able to push up using his elbows/forearms. By now, the primitive reflexes ought to be <b>integrated</b></p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic development</h3>
        <p>The baby starts to react to the environment even more: mouth is opened when hungry, and seeing a breast or bottle. The baby will also start to look either their own hands with interest. Linguistically, <b>cooing</b> starts around this time, even <b>in response</b> to talking to the baby by the parents. The head is also turned towards the sound of the parent's voice.</p>
        <h3>Social-emotional</h3>
        <p>The smile is used to draw the parents' attention, and slightly chuckles (note: not a full laugh) socially. </p>
    
        <h2>6 months</h2>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The baby should be able to roll <b>from tummy to back</b> and when in prone position, push up to straight arms. The baby should be able to sit <b>supported by their own hands</b>.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic development</h3>
        <p>Things are put in the baby's mouth to allow for oral exploration, and the baby learns to grab a toy themselves. Whereas at 4 months the baby learned to demand food when hungry, the baby will now close their mouth when full. Finally, "turn-taking" develops in language, as well as <b>linguistic play</b> (i.e., blowing raspberries etc.) and <b>squeeling</b>.</p>
        <h3>Social-emotional</h3>
        <p>A sense of <b>stranger-danger</b> develops, as the baby comes to know fimiliar people. At the same time, <b>a sense of self</b> is slowly developing as mirrors draw interest.</p>
    
        <h2>9 months</h2>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The baby is able to <b>reach a sitting position by themselves</b>, <b>move things from one hand to the other</b> and <b>rake food to oneself using fingers</b>. That seated position then, is held <b>without support</b>.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic development</h3>
        <p>By now, <b>discrete sounds</b> are distinguishable in the baby's speech and symbolic gestures (i.e., lifting of arms when desiring to be picked up) develop. Similarly, <b>object permanence</b> develops: looking for objects when dropped out of sight. The baby also learns to bang objects together.</p>
        <h3>Social-emotional</h3>
        <p>The <b>highpoint of separation anxiety</b>, a baby may be shy, clingy or fearful around strangers. To indicate this, <b>several facial expressions develop</b> such as happy, sad, angry or surprised. Similarly, the baby starts to react to their name, and is able to play peek-a-boo.</p>

    <!-- 12-18 MONTHS -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>12-36 Months: Toddler Independence</h1>
        
        <h2>12 months</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>By this time, the toddler has learned the concept of games and play.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>Symbolic gestures develop further, as the toddler learns to wave goodbye. Verbal language develops onto using words like "mama" and "dada", and the word "no" is understood. Cognitively, the toddler learns to <b>put objects in containers</b> and object permanence develops into <b>looking for objects they see you hide</b>.</p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The toddler is able to <b>pull up to standing</b>, and then walks while holding the furniture. When helped by their parents, the toddler is able to drink from a normal cup. Also, the <b>pincer grasp</b> is developed.</p>
    
        <h2>15 months</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>Slowly, behaviour starts to involve others: copying other children while playing, showing their parents an object they like etc. The toddler learns to <b>clap when excited</b> and hugs stuffed dolls or animals; similarly, the toddler learns to hug their parents.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>Language develops <b>beyond "mama" and "dada"</b> with one or two other words. When it comees to understanding though, they will look at objects when you name them, as well as follow directions when these are given with <b>both a gesture and a word</b>. Then, <b>pointing</b> becomes functional: asking for stuff. An attempt is made to use things such as phones, cups and books the right way, altough the toddler does not have to succeed. Lastly, they should be able to stack <b>2 blocks</b> on top of another.</p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The toddler should be able to take a few steps without support, and use their fingers to feed themselves.</p>
    
        <h2>24 months</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>A big jump in development, the toddler should be able to notice when others are hurt or upset. This is something they learn from their parents, as they <b>look at their parents faces to learn what an appropriate reaction is</b>.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>A toddler 2 years of age will not just point to objects when you name them, but also to <b>drawings of those objects</b>. By this age <b>2 words should be strung together</b> and gestures should develop beyond <b>point and waving</b> such as blowing a kiss, or nodding. </p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The toddler should be able to kick a ball and run. Stairs shouldn't be an issue (on two feet), and they should be able to <b>eat with a spoon</b>.</p>
    
        <h2>30 months: More autonomy</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>You can slowly start to expect play with other children, and even using "look at me!" to show their parents what the toddler can do. At the same time, the toddler will be able to learn <b>simple routines</b> such as picking up toys when prompted with "it's clean-up time!". </p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>Vocabulary by now should encompass about <b>50 words</b>, stringing <b>2 or more together</b> with one verb. At the same time, personal pronouns develop. In play, "pretend play" (.e.g, feeding a block to a doll) and simple problem-solving skills develop. The ability to follow <b>multi-step instructions</b> also develops, and colours are learned.</p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The hands are used to <b>twist things</b> (e.g., doorknowbs), can undress themselves, <b>jump</b> and turn the pages of a book.</p>

        <h2>36 months: More curiosity</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>Separation anxiety slowly decreases, and play starts to truly involve other children.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>A conversation should include at least <b>2 back-and-forth exchanges</b> and the toddler should start asking questions for themselves. They're also able to describe actions they're seeing in a book, as well as <b>their own name</b>. By now, even strangers should <b>be able to understand their speech</b>. They should be able to <b>draw a circle</b> and know not to touch hot objects.</p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>Fine manipulation develops as the toddler learns to string beads on a string, put on clothes and use a fork.</p>

        <h1>Childhood</h1>

        <h2>4 years: Out of the here-and-now</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>Pretend-play develops into <b>being able to pretend to be something else during play</b>, and will actively ask to play with others (even when they are not in sight). Empathy develops further into <b>comforting others when they are sad</b> and avoiding danger. The child at this stages likes to be involved in helping the adult, and knows to <b>change behaviour appropriately to the circumstances.</b></p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>The child says <b>sentences with four or more words</b> and can remember words from a song, story or nursery rhyme. The idea of a <b>past tense</b> develops, as the child talks about their day. Comprehension of the purpose of objects also develops. The child will be able to remember story lines, and be able to <b>draw a stick figure</b>.</p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>With the development of past tense, comes also the <b>catching of a large ball</b> (at least most of the time) and serving themselves food/water with adult supervision. Clothing-wise, the child is able to unbutton (some) buttons, and a pen/crayon is held properly (i.e., not in a fist).</p>

        <h2>5 years: Performance art</h2>
        <h3>Social-Emotional</h3>
        <p>Should be able to <b>sing, dance or act</b> and is able to help with simple chores at home like matching socks or clearing the table. Play then, <b>follows rules and takes turns</b>.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive/linguistic</h3>
        <p>Stories become more complex, involving <b>at least two events</b> and can answer simple questions about a book or story they've heard. A conversation at this point should involve more than three back-and-forth exchanges. Furthermore, the child should be able to <b>count to 10, recognise them written, use time words</b>, and have an attention span of 5-10 minutes. They should start to write some letters, and be able to recognise them.</p>
        <h3>Physical development</h3>
        <p>The child ought to be able to hop on one foot.</p>
