        <h1>Early development</h1>

        <p>Directly after the <b>blastula</b> stage, around the third week a process known as <b>gastrulation</b> occurs in which the embryo splits into three distinct layers: </p>

        <ol>

            <li>Ectoderm: Nervous system, skin, sensory organs</li>
            <li>Mesoderm: Muscles, bones, circ. system, connective tissue</li>
            <li>Endoderm: GI tract, lungs, internal organs</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Immediately after, the <b>neural plate</b> forms on the <b>ectoderm</b> which entails a small section <b>differentiating</b> influenced by the <b>notochord</b> and <b>paraxial mesoderm</b>. Then, in process called <b>neurulation</b>, the edges of the neural plate fold up, fuse and form the <b>neural tube</b>. This tube will become the <u>entire</u> CNS. From this same neural plate will form the <b>neural crest cells</b> which will come to make up the majority of the <b>peripheral nervous system</b> and <b>autonomic nervous system</b>.</p>

        <img src="Images/image_neural_crest.png">

        <h2>Neurulation</h2>

        <p>The process described above starts in <b>week 4 of development (~ day 22)</b> and starts from the cervical region going towards the tail-end. In the end, both ends, called the <b>neuropores</b>, stay open and remain in contact with the <b>amniotic cavity</b>. They eventually close a few days later (~ day 25), at which point <b>vascularisation of the nervous system</b> starts, as certain regions start to thicken which forms a recognisable brain, spinal cord and ventricles.</p>

        <h1>Differential development</h1>

        <p>The newly formed neural tube then starts developing in two distinct ways: the brain and the spinal cord. The cutoff for this is the <b>fourth pair of somites</b>. </p>

        <p>Towards the end of the preganancy, <b>myelination</b> starts, which continues throughout the first postnatal year. Myelinisation occurst <u>first</u> in the <b>motor roots</b> and <u>only then</u> in the <b>sensory roots</b>. In the CNS, this is done by the <b>oligodendrocytes</b>.</p>

        <img src="Images/image_somites.jpg">

        <h2>Spinal cord</h2>

        <p>The part caudal to that pair ends up forming the spinal cord. To this end the <b>walls thicken until only a very thin central canal is left</b>. The neuroepithelium surrounding this canal starts out as <b>epithelium</b> but ends up transforming into <b>neurons and macroglia</b>. However, they first form an intermediate stage called <b>neuroblasts</b> and <b>glio-/spongioblasts</b> respectively. As production of neurons and glia stops, the remaining cells turn into <b>ependymal cells</b> which will line the canal of the spinal cord as the <b>ependyma</b>.</p>

        <p>During this process of differentiation, eventually a <b>sulcus limitans</b> i.e., a long, thin groove on each side of the spinal cord which separates the <b>alar (i.e., dorsal) plate</b> from the <b>basal (i.e., ventral) plate</b>. As these plates span the entire length of the spinal cord, they eventually transform into the <b>dorsal gray columns/horns</b> and <b>ventral grey columns/horns</b>. Eventually, as these form, so does the <b>ventral/anterior median fissure</b>.</p>

        <p>Notably, the <b>dorsal root ganglia</b> spring not from the <b>neural tube</b> but from the cells of the <b>neural crest</b> as they form a sort of "hybrid part" between the CNS and PNS as they extend into the visceral organs where they perform a sensory role.</p>

        <p>At <b>8 weeks of gestation</b>, the spinal cord spans <b>the exact length of the vertebral canal</b>. This means that the spinal nerves pass through the intervetrebral formaina <b>at the exact level where they emerge from the cord</b>. As the embryo grows faster than the cord, the caudal nerves have to stretch to still sprout from their vertebral canals and we end up with the cauda equina. At the <b>end of the pregnancy</b>, the spinal cord stops around <b>S1</b>. As the child continues to grow outside of the uterus, eventually, the spinal cord will end around <b>L1</b> instead. That then forms the aforementioned cauda equina, where the dura and arachnoid mater end at <b>S2</b> while the <b>pia mater</b> forms a long, thread like structure called the <b>filum terminale</b> which starts the the <b>conus medullaris</b> and runs all the way to the the <b>first coccygeal vertebra</b>.</p>

        <h2>Brain development</h2>

        <p>Even before the neural folds fully fuse, three vesicles may be recognised cranially to the fourth somite:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Prosencephalon: Forebrain</li>
            <li>Mesencephalon: Midbrain</li>
            <li>Rhombencephalon: Hindbrain</li>

        </ol>

        <div class="mnemonic"><b>Pro</b> = <b>Fore</b>, <b>Mes</b> = <b>Mid</b></div>

        <p>Then, in week 4 of gestation, the primitive brain bends <b>anteriorly</b> which forms the midbrain and cervical flexures. Then in <b>week 5 of gestation</b> the:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Prosencephalon -> Telencephalon & Diencephalon</li>
            <li>Rhombencephalon -> Metencephalon & Myelencephalon</li>

        </ol>

        <p>This lends us with a total of <b>five brain vesicles</b> in <b>week five of gestation</b>. At this point, the sulcus limitans and hence the alar/basal plates are recognisable up and until the midbrain.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">This is clear, no?</div>

        <p>Essential in recognising the various structures then, the various flexures are essential. They form because of a different tempo of growth. The <b>cervical flexure</b> then, marks the transition from <b>hindbrain (i.e., rhombencephalon)</b> to <b>spinal cord</b>, while the <b>pontine flexure</b> marks the transition from <b>hindbrain (i.e., rhombencephalon)</b> to <b>mesencephalon</b>. The latter will eventually become the <b>pons (hence the name) and cerebellum</b>.</p>

        <img src="Images/image_flexures.jpg">

        <p>On that note, talking about the various structures in the hindbrain:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Metencephalon (rostral) -> pons (basal plate), cerebellum (alar plate)</li>
            <li>Myelencephalon (caudal) - > medulla oblongata</li>
            <li>Hindbrain cavity -> fourth ventricle</li>

        </ol>

        <p>The midbrain then, contains the <b>cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius</b> which connects the CSF to flow between the third and fourth ventricles. Here, the plates split as such:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Alar plate -> Tectum (colliculi)</li>
            <li>Basal plate -> Other nuclei of the midbrain</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Forebrain</h3>

        <p>Remember that the neuropores close around day 25? Well, it is <b>around that same day</b> that the <b>optic vesicles</b> develop as two outgrowths <b>lateral</b> to the forebrain. At the same time, on the front and back part of the developing front brain, two diverticula develop into the <b>telencephalic vesicles</b>, they contain cavities. The vesicles themselves will become the cerebral hemispheres, while the cavities will become the lateral ventricles, connected to the third ventricle through the <b>foramen of Monro</b>.</p>

        <p>The <b>Thalamus, Hypothalamus, mammilary bodies, and epithalamus</b> then, derive from the <b>lateral walls of the third ventricle</b>.</p>

        <p>The <b>pituitary gland</b> is a strange case: the anterior part (the adenohypofysis) springs from <b>oral ectoderm (i.e., the hypophysial diverticulum a.k.a. Rathke's pouch)</b>. The <b>posterior part (i.e., neurohypophysis)</b> forms from a <b>downgroth of the neuroectoderm from the diencephalon</b> which becomes the <b>neurohypoophysial diverticulum</b>. With the anterior part coming up, and the posterior part coming down, in <b>week 5</b> they touch and slowly the hypophysial diverticulum soon disappears.</p>

        <p>From <b>week 6</b>, the <b>corpus striatum</b> is distinguishable at the base of each cerebral hemisphere. These hemispheres then grow much faster than the striatum (i.e., the floor), which results in C-shaped hemispheres.</p>

        <h2>Meninges</h2>

        <p>The entire neural tube and neural crest is surrounded by <b>mesenchyme</b> which divides into two layers: the outer becomes the <b>dura mater</b> and the inner the <b>leptomeninges (i.e., arachnoid mater and pia mater)</b>. At that point, CSF will start to form.</p>

        <p>The pia mater will eventually cover the entire roof of the fourth ventricle (i.e., hindbrain), after which she keeps proliferating, eventually extending <u>into</u> the fourth ventricle to form the <b>choroid plexus</b>. The same happens to the <b>third ventricle</b>. In order to manage the flow of CSF produced by these plexus, three foramen form in the fourth ventricle: two lateral <b>foramina of Luschka</b> and a single medial <b>foramen of Magendie</b>. These open up into the <b>subarachnoid space</b>.</p>
