        <h1>Milestones</h1>

        <p>When talking about age in human development in-utero, we talk about two often conflated terms <b>Gestational Age (GA)</b>, which starts counting from the first day of the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and <b>timing</b> which refers to days from fertilisation (i.e., GA - 10). When talking about stages from development, these indications of timing then refer to ideals or averages, not to <i>actual</i> milestones which every baby should or will reach.</p>

        <p>Until week 8 (GA 10), we talk about the <b>embryonic period</b> of development, which is indeed focussed on development of the major organ systems. The first month is referred to as the <b>neonatal period</b>.</p>

        <p>Week 9 until 37 (GA 11-39) are then referred to as the <b>foetal period</b> of development. By the start of the foetal period, all major organ systems have mostly formed and this stage is thus focussed on <b>growth.</b></p>
        <div class="mnemonic"><b>E</b> comes before <b>F</b> in the alphabet, as <b>embryogenesis</b> comes before the <b>foetus</b></div>

        <h1>Early embryogenesis</h1>

        <p><b>fertilisation</b> takes place when the gametes fuse together, which usually happens in the <b>ampulla of the follopian tubes</b>. This fertilisation is dependant on three factors: <b>chemotaxis</b>, <b>adhesive compatibility</b> and <b>acrosomal reaction</b>.</p>
        <p>Chemotaxis is the process that guides the movement of the spermatozoon towards the ovum. The adhesive compatibility ensures the spermatozoon actually adheres to the ovum. The acrosomal reaction finally, entails the entering spermatozoon being capped by an acrosome which is filled with enzymes that break down the <b>zona pellucida</b> or protective barrier around the oöcyte. On entry, the so-called <b>zona reaction</b> takes place, which leads the oöcyte to release cortical granules to prevent polyspermy.</p>

        <h2>Cleavage</h2>
        <p>This process starts when the newly formed zygote divides in two through mitosis. Each division takes <b>between 12 and 24 hours</b>. This continues until <b>eight blastomeres</b>, i.e., eight cells formed by cleavage, have formed within the zona pellucida of the ovum. After that point, they start to compact and form gap junctions. When the cells number <b>sixteen</b>, the baby is then referred to as a <b>morula</b>.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic"><b>MORE</b> of morula rhymes with <b>four</b> and there are four cleavages (i.e., 16 cells) before morulation </div>

        <h2>Blastulation</h2>
        <p>While cleavage could already be called the first stage of blastulation, the actual blastocyst forms when cells differentiate in <b>an outer layer</b> called the <b>trophoblast</b>, an inner pole called the <b>inner cell mass</b> and a cavity (i.e., the part within the trophoblast not covered by the inner cell mass) called the <b>blastocoele</b>. Eventually, the blastocoele inflates with fluid from the trophoblasts and bursts through the zona pellucida which will desintegrate away. This happens on <b>day six</b> of the pregnancy, and makes way for implantation. It is from the inner cell mass that <b>the pre-embryo, amnion, yolk sac and allantois</b> form, while the trophoblasts will form the <b>foetal part of the placenta</b>.</p>

        <h2>Differentiation</h2>
        <p>Shortly after implantation, namely <b>at the beginning of week 2</b> the bilaminar germ discs forms which contains two layers: <b>hypoblast</b> (lower layer) and <b>epiblast</b> (upper layer). On the side of the trophoblasts, which have by now attached to the endometrium, two sub-layers form too: <b>cytotrophoblast</b> and <b>synctiotrophoblast</b>. For a while, this will be covered by <b>Heuser's membrane</b>. The latter will eventually develop into the <b>yolk sac</b>.</p>
        <p>The upper layer, epiblast, is made of columnar layer and lies adjacent to the trophoblast. The hypoblast lies adjacent to the blastocyst cavity and is made from cuboidal cells. </p>

        <h2>Gastrulation</h2>
        <p>As the both the epiblast migrates downward (forming the amniotic cavity) and the hypoblast does the same (forming Heuser's membrane and the yolk sac), the epiblast leaves behind a <b>primitive streak</b> which determines the symmetric head-to-tail direction of the embryo. This takes place around <b>day 17</b> of fertilisation. After, a <b>primitive node</b> forms, which will organise neurulation. In the centre thereof, a <b>primitive pit</b> forms, which connects to the directly underlying <b>notochord</b>. As the epiblasts from the centre of the primitive streak move downword in a process called <b>ingression</b>, the <b>mesoderm</b> forms from those epiblasts. Then, the hypoblast is pushed out of the way to form the <b>amnion</b>. The bilaminar disc has now formed three layers and has become trilaminar, the <b>gastrula</b>.</p>
        <p>These three layers, the <b>ectoderm</b>, <b>mesoderm</b> and <b>endoderm</b> will form all organ structures and will be treated in their respective organ systems.</p>

        <h1>The Gastrula</h1>

        <h2>The Mesoderm</h2>
        <p>The <b>mesoderm</b> has forms from the epiblast through gastrulation. It has four major parts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Axial mesoderm</li>
            <li>Paraxial mesoderm</li>
