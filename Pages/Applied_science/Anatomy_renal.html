    </div>
    
    <div class="explanation-card">

        <p>They kidneys lie <b>retroperitoneally</b> on either side of the vertebral column. Roughly, they extend from <b>T12 to L3</b> with the <b>right kidney</b> being <b>slightly higher</b>. Immediately superior to the kidneys sit the adrenal glands, which are enveloped in renal fascia.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The kidneys are directly envolped in the aforementioned renal capsule. This capsule is coated in a thick layer of <b>perirenal fat</b>. Surrounding this thick layer of fat, lies the <b>renal fascia</b> which is then coated <b>posterolaterally</b> in <b>pararenal fat</b>.

    <div class="explanation-card">

        <p>Internally, the renal parenchyma may be divided into two main areas: <b>cortex and medulla</b>. The cortex extends into the medulla in triangular shapes called the <b>renal pyramids</b>.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        These renal pyramids end in <b>renal papilla</b>. These papilla attach individually to <b>renal calices (singular: calyx)</b> which in turn connect to a number of larger collecting vats called <b>major calices (singular: calyx)</b> which then collects into a singular <b>renal pelvis</b> which in turn connects the kidney to the ureter. External structures such as indeed the ureter, connect with the kidney at a deep fissure called the <b>renal hilum</b>.

        <p>
        Blood supply is arranged through the <b>renal arteries</b>, which branch directly off the aorta abdominalis, immediately distal to the origin of the <b>a. mesenterica superior</b>. Noteworthy is that the right renal artery is <b>longer</b> and crosses the vena cava. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Both renal arteries then enter their respective kidney through the renal hilum, where they immediately divide into a <b>posterior and anterior division</b> which supply respectively <b>75% and 25%</b> of the renal blood supply. Each division then sprouts <b>five segmental arteries</b>. Along the lateral plane of the kidney runs the imaginary <b>line of Brodel</b> which is the avascular plane dividing the portions supplied by the anterior and posterior sections. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        Now on a microscopic level, the segmental arteries divide into <b>interlobar arteries</b> which are situated on <b>either side of every renal pyramid</b>. These then divide into <b>arcuate arteries</b>, perpendicular to which the <b>interlobular arteries</b> sprout. It is they that pass <b>through the cortex</b>, where they divide into the <b>afferent arterioles</b>.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        For the outer two-thirds of the kidney the <b>peritubular network</b> supplies the nephrons with oxygen and nutrients, whereas the <b>vasa recta</b> fulfill this role for the inner two-thirds.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        Of course, both kidneys drain into renal veins, of which the <b>left</b> is <b>longer</b>, having to cross the aorta abdominalis anteriorly in order to reac the vena cava.
