        <h1>Cells of the immune system</h1>
        <p>Just as with all lessons within the histology section, we are going to focus on the cells and not necessarily their functions within the larger system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        
        <h1>Cellular development</h1>
        <p>The cells of the immune system first have to develop before they are active within the immune system. The image below presents an overview of that development:</p>

        <img src="Images/image_immune.jpg"/>

        <p>In general, the immune cells may be divided into two groups:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Granulocytes: Mast cells, Basophils, Neutrophils and Eosinophils</li>
            <li>Agranulocytes: Monocytes and lymphocytes</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Granulocytes</h2>
        <p>This distinction is made on the basis of so-called <b>specific granules</b> which are secretory vesicles found only in cells of these granulocytes. They store a mixture of cytotoxic molecules such as enzymes and antimicrobial peptides. The process of attacking other cells using these granules is called <b>degranulation</b>. Because these cells all have segmented or irregular nuclei, they are also called <b>polymorphonuclear leukocytes</b>. As they call come from the <b>common myeloid progenitor</b>, the process of <b>granulopoiesis</b> takes place in the bone marrow. Granulocytes have rather short life-span, namely only <b>2 days</b>.</p>

        <h3>Neutrophils</h3>
        <p>Taking up about 60% of all granulocytes, the neutrophil is the most abundant of all granulocytes. They circulate in the blood until they receive a signal, after which they take around 30 minutes to reach the site of infection, do their job and turn into pus. The granules of the monocyte fulfill two functions, namely intra- and extracellular killing. As such, the monocyte has three methods of killing pathogens: 1) Phagocytosis with intracellular killing, 2) Degranulation and 3) so-called <i>neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)</i>. The latter refers to a network of chromatin and serine proteases which trap and kill microbes extracellularly. In terms of communication, the neutrophil may stimulate monocytes and macrophages to increase phagocytosis.</p>
        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>neutro</b>phil is the most abundant and has the most functions; it could as well be the <b>neutral</b> immune cell!</div>

        <h3>Eosinophils</h3>
        <p>The Eosinophil is specifically suited to kill parasites (such as enteric nematodes) through degranulation using their specific granules. While their phagocytosis capabilities are limited, they are <b>professional antigen-presenting</b> cells and hence regulate other immune cell functions.</p>
        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>E</b>osinophil is built to kill (often <b>e</b>nteric) parasites</div>

        <h3>Basophils</h3>
        <p>These cells are the least abundant of all the immune cells and mostly aid in the immune response by providing a <b>histamine</b> release upon injury in the site of infeciton. This causes dilation of the local capillaries.</p>

        <h3>Mast cells</h3>
        <p>Uniquely so amongst the granulocytes, the mast cell does not need to travel to the site of infection as <b>it is present in tissue</b>. Releasing histamine too, it is mostly involved in the regulation of host defense and allergic reactions.</p>
        <div class="mnemonic">Like a flagpole (a.k.a. <b>mast</b>) the <b>mast</b>cell stays in place and marks the site</div>

        <h2>Agranulocytes</h2>
        <p>These cells do not contain any granules and thus have to resort to other methods to fulfill their ultimate function: protect the body.</p>

        <h3>Monocytes</h3>
        <p>These cells, namely <b>macrophages</b> and <b>myeloid dendritic cells</b> also descend from the common myeloid progenitor. Their main function is phagocytosis, but they also present parts of the pathogen to T-cells which may use it either to build up memory or to mount an antibody response.</p>
        <div class="mnemonic">The macro<b>phage</b> does <b>phago</b>cytosis</div>
        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>macro</b>phage <b>enlarges</b> the immune response by presenting pathogens</div>

        <h3>lymphocytes</h3>
        <p>A much more complex group, the lymphocytes descend from the <b>common lymphoid progenitor</b> and can be split into three groups: 1) Natural Killer (NK) cells, 2) T-cells and 3) B-cells. The latter function to make antibodies which bind to pathogens, enabeling their destruction (called <b>adaptive opsonisation</b>). NK cells are then however unique in their capability of recognising and killing destressed cells without any form of externally applied marking. T-cells may be split into three types: Cytotoxic (CD8+), Helper (CD4+) or Memory. </p>

        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>lymph</b>ocytes descend from the common <b>lymph</b>oid progenitor</div>
        <div class="mnemonic"><b>Natural</b> Killer cells may kill <b>natural</b> (i.e., unmarked) cells</div>
        <div class="mnemonic"><b>B</b>-cells make anti<b>b</b>odies</div>
        <div class="mnemonic">CD<b>4+</b> comes before (i.e., marks) CD<b>8+</b> cells</div>
