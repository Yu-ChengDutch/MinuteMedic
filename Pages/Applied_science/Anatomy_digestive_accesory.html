        <h1>(Retro)peritoneal structures</h1>
        <p>The peritoneum is a serous membrane lining the abdominal cavity. It supports the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their blood vesels, lymphatic vessels and nerves. Based on their position relative to this membrane, all abdominal organs are one of three things:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Intraperitoneal: Stomach, jejenum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon transversus, colon sigmoidium, spleen, ovaries, liver</li>
            <li>Retroperitoneal: Colon ascendens, colon descendens, kidneys, adrenal glands, renal vessels, aorta, vena cava inferior</li>
            <li>Infra-/subperitoneal: bladder, gonadal blood vessels, uterus, fallopian tubes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Exceptions are the <b>pancreas</b> which is retroperitoneal save for the tail, the <b>duodenum</b> which is retroperitoneal save for the first bit, the <b>ureters</b> which are retroperitoneal save for the most distal part which lies infraperitoneal and the <b>rectum</b> which lies intra-, then retro-, then infraperitoneal.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">All <b>in</b>testines lie <b>in</b>traperitoneal, except for the vertical bits (ascendens, descendens and rectum)</div>
        <div class="mnemonic">The entire urinary tract lies outside of the peritoneum</div>
        <div class="mnemonic">Oocytes follow the same path as feces: intra- to infraperitoneal</div>

        <p>The peritoneum then is divided into two main "sacs": the <b>greater sac</b> and the <b>lesser sac</b>, the latter of which is divided into the <b>omentum minus</b> (essentially a ligament coneecting the stomach and liver (lig. hepatogastricum), and the duodenum and liver (lig. hepatoduodenicum). Posteriorly to itself, it forms <b>lesser sac (i.e., bursa omentalis)</b>. This lesser sac indeed is connected to the greater sac through the <b>omental foramen (i.e., foramen of Winslow)</b> and may commonly contain considerable amounts of fat. The <b>omentum majus</b> hangs down from the <b>greater curvature of the stomach</b> and loops down in front of the intestines before attaching to the <b>colon transversus</b>, essentially being draped in front like an apron, insulating the abdominal organs.</p>
    
        <p>In terms of development, only the <b>urinary, circulatory and digestive</b> elements are <b>primarily retroperitoneal</b>. The <b>duodenum, colon and pancreas</b> are <b>secondarily retroperitoneal</b> meaning they start suspended in mesentary and later migrate during development.</p>

        <h1>The liver</h1>

        <p>It is located in the right upper quadrant, intra- or mesoperitoneally. It is the largest gland in the human body, and forms a part of the accesory digestion glands. It has two surfaces:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Diaphragmatic surface: partially not covered by peritoneum and thus in direct contact with the diaphragm <b>bare area of the liver</b></li>
            <li>Visceral surface: covered in peritoneum; follows shape of surrounding organs</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A number of ligaments attach to the liver:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Falciform ligament: attaches the anterior liver to the anterior wall. It contains the <b>lig. teres</b> (remnant of the umbilical vein)</li>
            <li>Coronary ligament: a broad ligament that attaches the liver to the diaphragm. It circumscribes the <b>bare area of the liver</b></li>
            <li>Triangular ligaments: end points of the coronary ligament</li>
            <li>Omentum minus: as described above, forms a flat ligament between liver, stomach and duodenum</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Clinically relevant is the space between the liver and the right kidney called <b>Morison's pouch or recessus subhepatici</b> which forms the deepest part of the abdomen when lying flat. In case of intra-abdominal fluid in a supine position, it may collect here. It is the equivalent of the <b>pouch of Douglas</b>, which is the deepest point when standing.</p>

        <h2>Hepatic circulation</h2>
        <p>Crucially, the liver is supplied through two ways:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A. Hepatica (25%): Supplies blood to non-parenchymal structures</li>
            <li>V. Portalis hepatica (75%): Runs from the <b>small intestine</b> to the liver, carrying <b>partially deoxygenated blood</b> and allowing the liver to perform gut-related functions such as detoxification</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Veinous drainage goes through the <b>V. Hepatica inferior</b>.</p>

        <h2>Lobes of the liver</h2>
        <p>The liver is covered in <b>Glisson's capsule</b> which separates a <b>right and left lobe</b>. The <b>right lobe</b> is significantly larger and contains two accesory lobes: <b>caudate lobe</b> and <b>quadrate lobe</b>. The latter are separate by a deep transverse fissure called the <b>porta hepatis</b> which is where all vessels, nerves and ducts enter and leave except the <b>hepatic veins</b>.</p>
        
        <p><b>Couinaud</b> made a classification of lobes, where the left lobe is separated in an upper and lower part (respectively <b>Couinaud 2 and 3</b>). The left lobe is separated from the right one by the <b>lig. Falciforme</b> and the first section of the right lobe is called <b>Couinaud 4</b> which runs untill <b>Cantlie's line</b>. Posteriorly thereto lies <b>Couinaud 1</b>. The rest of the right lobe is then divided clockwise starting from the bottom left in <b>Couinaud 5, 6, 7 and 8</b>.</p>
        <p>In this system, the quadrate lobe is comparable to the bottom of the medial segment, i.e., Couinaud 4b. The caudate lobe, Couinaud I, forms the roof of the porta hepalis.</p>

        <img src="Images/image_liver_couinaud.jpeg">

        <h2>Hepatic nervous system</h2>
        <p>The parenchym is supplied through the <b>hepatic plexus</b> consisting of two parts: the <b>sympathetic coelic plexus</b> and <b>parasympathetic N. Vagus</b>. Everything enters through the <b>porta hepatis</b>. <b>Glisson's capsule</b> covering the liver, is supplied by the <b>Nn. Intercostales</b> and distension creates a sharp, well localised pain.</p>

        <h1>The gallbladder</h1>
        <p>The <b>cholecyst</b> is a pear-shaped, hollow organ where bile is stored after it is produced in the liver. The largest point (the "bottom") is called the <b>fundus</b>, with the tip being referred to as the neck. The neck openes up into the <b>ductus cysticus</b>, right before which the wall of the gallbladder pouches out slightly, called <b>Hartmann's pouch</b>. The <b>common hepatic duct (ductus hepaticus communis)</b> arises from the <b>left and right hepatic ducts</b> which lie within the liver. Around the gallbladder the d. cysticus and d. hepaticus commuis converge to form the <b>common bile duct (ductus choledochus)</b>. Right before exiting into the intestines, the d. choledochus converges with the <b>ductus pancreaticus</b> to form the <b>ampulla hepatopancreaticus (Ampulla of Vater)</b> which then opens up into the <b>major duodenal papilla (Papilla of Oddi)</b>. The system of ducts described is called the biliary tree.</p>
        <p>An anatomical variation does occur where the top of the fundus is pulled anteriorly, called the <b>Phrygian cap</b>, named after the similarly named historical cap. It has no medical implications.</p>

        <h1>The pancreas</h1>
        <p>The pancreas is divided into a <b>head, neck, body and tail</b> from right to left. This means the head lies in midline (in the curve of the duodenum) and the tail nearly touches the spleen. Furthermore, this means the pancreas lies <b>retroperitoneally</b> save for the tail which lies <b>intraperitoneally</b> with the spleen.</p>
        <p>There are two ducts leading out of the pancreas: <b>ductus accesorius (d. Santorini), and ductus pancreaticus (d. Wirsung)</b>. The ductus pancreaticus is controlled by the <b>sphincter of Boyden</b> before passing into the ductus choledochus. </p>

        <h2>Pancreatic circulation</h2>
        <p>The pancreas is supplied arterially through branches of the <b>coeliac artery</b> and <b>superior mesenteric artery</b>. Crucially, the coeliac artery branches into the splenic artery, which supplies the left side of the body and the entire tail, while the superior mesenteric branches in to the <b>pancreaticuduodenal arteries</b> which run along the posterior/anterior surfaces to supplied the head and body.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">The coe<b>l</b>iac artery becomes the sp<b>l</b>enic artery, supplying the tai<b>l</b>. While the supe<b>r</b>io<b>r</b> mesenteric artery supplies the <b>r</b>est.</div>
