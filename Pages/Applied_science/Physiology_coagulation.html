        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Hemostasis is the process that <b>stops bleeding</b>. It involves <b>plasma, platelet and vascular components</b>. There are four main stages:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Vasoconstriction</li>
            <li>Activation of platelets and platelet plug</li>
            <li>Coagulation cascade</li>
            <li>Fibrin clot formation</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Vasoconstriction</h2>

        <p>The blood vessels consist of many layers, on of which is the <b>smooth muscle layer</b>. This layer is generally innervated by the <b>sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight)</b> and not at all by the parasympathetic i.e., "feed and breed" nervous system. Generally however, if there are any substances causing vasoconstriction, they have another way of causing <b>calcium influx</b>. In case of <b>endothelial damage</b> this is done by the release of the substances <b>thromboxane</b> and <b>endothelin</b>. Many other factors may contribute to increased endothelin production: products of platelet activation, thrombin, insulin and even hypoxia.</p>

        <h2>Platelet activation</h2>

        <p>Platelets contain on their surface <b>glycoproteins</b> amongst which is <b>glycoprotein Ia/IIa</b> which has an affinity for <b>type I and IV collagen</b>. Normally, the collagenous layer of the vessel is not exposed, but injury will expose it. This means that the platelets will stick to the site of injury. <b>Von Willebrandfactor</b> released by the platelets and the damaged site, serves to strengthen that bond. The connection between the wall and platelet causes the latter to <b>activate</b>: a cascade is put in motion to continue the process.</p>

        <p>Activated platelets will release the content of stored gradules: <b>ADP, serotonin, platelet-activating factor, vWFd, thromboxane A2</b>, all of which serve to activate again more platelets. Lastly, the platelet changes shape from spherical to stellate.</p>

        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <p>What does the Von Willebrand factor do?</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">
            <li data-answer="wrong">Create a bond</li>
            <li data-answer="correct">Strengthen a bond</li>

        <h1>Coagulation cascade</h1>
        
        <p>The coagulation cascade consists of three discrete parts:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Intrinsic: Triggered by surface contact</li>
            <li>Extrinsic: Triggered by tissue damage</li>
            <li>Common: Uniting the former pathways</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Essentially, the product of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways is exactly the same: namely, an enzyme to convert <b>factor X into <u>activated</u> factor X</b>. The common pathway then, exists to take factor X and create <b>fibrin</b>. It does so by using factor Xa to convert prothrombin into thrombin, which in turn converts <b>fibrinogen</b> into <b>fibrin</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="Images/image_cascade.png">

        <p><b>Protein C</b> then, inhibits factors VII and V, thus modulating their activation.</p>

        <h2>Vitamin K-dependance</h2>

        <p>Vitamin K is involved in blood clotting, as it essential to the addition of a carboxyl group to these factors in the liver. The factors where this is t he case are <b>II, VII, IX and X</b> as well as all of the named proteins <b>Protein s, Protein C, Protein Z</b>. Protein C, as discussed in an inhibitor of factors Va and VIIIa. Protein S serves as co-factor in this inhibition. <b>Protein Z</b>, then, is responsible for the <b>degradation of Factor Xa</b> (which, as you remember, is the product of the in- and extrinsic cascades).</p>
        <p>The necessity of the protein C inhibition, becomes clear in the <b>"Leiden" variant of factor V</b> which is a mutation in the production of factor V which causes <b>protein C to be unable to bind to factor V</b> which in turn creates an unchecked cascade, leading to <b>hypercoagulability</b>. The condition is inherited <b>autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance</b>, and has no current cure. It occurs in up to <b>5% of the general caucasian population</b> and nearly <b>30% of people with DVT</b>, occuring more often in whites than any other population.</p>

        <h1>Fibrinolysis</h1>

        <p>Eventually, the now formed blood clot has to dissolve again. This accomplished through the use of an enzyme called <b>plasmin</b> which is produced from <b>plasminogen</b> in the <b>liver</b>. Eventually, plasmin breaks down the clot into <b>fibrin degradation products (FDPs)</b> which in turn <b>compete with thrombin</b> which causes the inhibition of clot formation, as thrombin is necessary for the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. A specific test for fibrinolysis then, is the <b>D-dimer</b> which is one of the FDPs. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, one may use <b>thromboelastometry (TEM)</b> which measures the time to clot, as well as the final elasticity of the clot, using a rotating needle swirling through the clot. It is don on whole blood, and is a very fast test possible in a Point of Care (PoC) setting.</p>
