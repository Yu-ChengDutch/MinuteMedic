    <h1>Introduction: The Physiology of Muscle Contraction</h1>
    <p>
        The process of muscle contraction underpins virtually every voluntary and involuntary movement in the human body. From the rhythmic contractions of the heart to the coordinated activities of skeletal muscles during locomotion, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain fundamentally conserved. Understanding the physiology of muscle contraction requires a multidisciplinary appreciation of <strong>anatomy</strong>, <strong>biochemistry</strong>, and <strong>neurophysiology</strong>. While often first studied in undergraduate physiology courses, this topic gains clinical relevance in specialties such as <strong>internal medicine</strong> and <strong>physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R)</strong>, especially when evaluating patients with neuromuscular disorders, critical illness myopathy, or spasticity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three primary muscle types exist in the human body: <strong>skeletal</strong>, <strong>cardiac</strong>, and <strong>smooth muscle</strong>. Of these, skeletal muscle is the most extensively studied in classical physiology, and its mechanisms serve as a didactic model. Skeletal muscles are composed of <strong>striated, multinucleated muscle fibers</strong> arranged into fascicles. Each fiber contains numerous myofibrils, which in turn are built from repeating contractile units called <strong>sarcomeres</strong>. These sarcomeres are the smallest functional unit of a muscle and rely on the highly organized interaction between two principal protein filaments: <strong>actin</strong> (thin filaments) and <strong>myosin</strong> (thick filaments).
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically, our understanding of muscle contraction has progressed from Luigi Galvani’s 18th-century experiments demonstrating the electrical excitability of muscle, to the sliding filament theory proposed by Huxley and Niedergerke in the 1950s, which remains the dominant explanatory model today.

    <h2>The Sarcomere and Sliding Filament Theory</h2>
    <p>
        Each sarcomere is demarcated by <strong>Z-lines</strong>, which anchor the thin actin filaments. The thick filaments composed of myosin are located centrally and span the <strong>A-band</strong>, overlapping with the actin filaments. Contraction occurs when these filaments slide past one another, shortening the sarcomere without changing the length of the individual filaments themselves. This mechanism, known as the <strong>sliding filament theory</strong>, explains how a microscopic structural change results in macroscopic movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The myosin heads bind to actin filaments and, using energy from ATP hydrolysis, pull the actin filaments inward in a cyclical process called the <strong>cross-bridge cycle</strong>. This results in sarcomere shortening and, consequently, muscle contraction. Importantly, calcium ions and ATP are essential cofactors in this process. Calcium binds to <strong>troponin C</strong>, which causes a conformational shift in <strong>tropomyosin</strong>, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin and permitting the cross-bridge cycle to proceed.

    <div class="explanation-card">
    <h2>Excitation-Contraction Coupling</h2>
    <p>
        Before contraction can occur, an electrical signal must be converted into a mechanical response — a process called <strong>excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling</strong>. This begins at the <strong>neuromuscular junction</strong>, where an action potential arriving at the axon terminal of a motor neuron triggers the release of <strong>acetylcholine</strong> into the synaptic cleft. This neurotransmitter binds to nicotinic receptors on the sarcolemma, leading to sodium influx, depolarization of the muscle fiber, and propagation of an action potential along the sarcolemma and into the <strong>T-tubules</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The T-tubules are closely associated with the <strong>sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)</strong>, which stores calcium. Depolarization activates voltage-sensitive receptors (DHPR) in the T-tubules, which in turn interact with <strong>ryanodine receptors (RyR1)</strong> in the SR, resulting in calcium release. The sudden increase in intracellular calcium concentration enables the cross-bridge cycle to begin.

        <li data-answer="correct">They sense depolarization and activate ryanodine receptors</li>

        <li data-answer="wrong">They hydrolyze ATP to fuel the power stroke</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
    <h2>Termination of Contraction and Role of ATP</h2>
    <p>
        Muscle contraction is terminated by the removal of calcium from the cytoplasm. This is achieved by the <strong>SERCA pump</strong> (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase), which actively transports calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The absence of calcium causes troponin to revert to its resting conformation, allowing tropomyosin to block the actin-binding sites once more.
    </p>
    <p>
        ATP plays several roles in muscle contraction: it is required to <strong>detach the myosin head</strong> from actin, to <strong>reset the myosin head</strong> into a high-energy state, and to fuel the <strong>SERCA pump</strong>. In the absence of ATP, as seen in rigor mortis, the myosin head remains bound to actin, resulting in sustained contraction.

    <h2>Clinical Correlation: Muscle Disorders and Contraction Deficits</h2>
    <p>
        In clinical practice, disruptions in muscle contraction can present in diverse ways, from <strong>flaccid paralysis</strong> in lower motor neuron disease to <strong>spasticity</strong> in upper motor neuron syndromes. Disorders such as <strong>myasthenia gravis</strong> impair neuromuscular transmission by targeting acetylcholine receptors, while <strong>critical illness myopathy</strong> may affect the actin-myosin interface or calcium regulation. Understanding where in the excitation-contraction cascade pathology occurs helps guide both diagnosis and therapy.
