    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Temperature regulation</h1>
        <p>One of the roles of the <b>hypothalamus</b> is to regulate body temperature. The area of the hypothalamus most involed therein is the <b>preoptic area</b> or <b>POA</b> as seen in the picture below. The POA might be thought of as the body's thermostat and contains the central thermoreceptors monitoring the body's core temperature and comparing it to the average of 37.3 C.</p>

        <h2>Input to the system</h2>
        <p>While the POA forms the central control unit, it needs input. For that, it uses the <b>peripheral thermoreceptors</b> which are located in the skin. While the thermorceptors connect to both A-delta fibers and C-fibers, it is mainly the <b>A-delta fibers</b> that are responsible for <b>cold and sharp pain</b>, while the <b>C-fibers are responsible</b> for <b>warmth and dull pain or prolonged sensations.</b> They then enter the spinal cord through the <b>dorsal root ganglia</b>, synapse in the <b>dorsal horn</b> and follow the <b>spinothalamic tract</b> with temperature sensation and pain mostly located in the <b>lateral spinothalamic tract</b>. Here, it arrives to the <b>thalamus</b> where it synapses and information is relayed to both the <b>somatosensory cortex</b> and <b>hypothalamus</b>.</p>
        
        <h3>Pyrogens</h3>
        <p>Now, besides the "normal" input of the thermoreceptors, there are so-called pyrogens which are able to hyperactivate the hypothalamus. These are classes as <b>exogenous pyrogens</b> and <b>endogenous pyrogens.</b></p>
        <p>Exogenous pyrogens are those pyrogens coming from outside the body, typically produced by bacteria or viruses.</p>
        <p>Endogenous pyrogens are those pyrogens produced by the body, possibly in response to pathogens, such as IL-1, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.</p>
        <h3>Pyrogenic stimulation of the hypothalamus</h3>
        <p>Through the <b>direct pathway</b> pyrogens cross into the brain at the <b>Organum Vasculosum of the Lamina Terminalis or OVLT</b>, a part of the hypothalamus without blood brain-barrier.</p>
        <p>Following the <b>indirect pathway</b>, pyrogens stimulate the blood-brain barrier to produce <b>prostaglandins</b> particularly <b>prostaglandin E2</b> which then stimulates the POA.</p>
        
        <h2>Output of the system</h2>
        <p>Now that the set-point has been ... set, the body needs a way to regulate body temperature, for this it uses <b>autonomic pathways</b>, <b>endocrine pathways</b> and <b>behavioural responses</b></p>

        <div class="mnemonic"><b>A</b>-delta fibers carry <b>AAAAAAAH!</b> and <b>C</b>-fibers carry <b>we'll see</b></div>

        <h3>Autonomic pathways</h3>
        <p>In response to <b>cold</b>, the body activates the <b>sympathatic nervous system</b>. This then causes <b>vasoconstriction</b>, <b>shivering thermogenesis</b>, and <b>non-shivering thermogenesis</b> such as activation of brown adipose tissue and metabolic changes.</p>
        <p>In response to <b>heat</b>, the body activates the <b>parasympathetic nervous system</b> which causes vasodilation and sweating.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>p</b>arasympathetic system is to <b>party / heat </b> while the <b>sympathetic</b> system is the opposite</div>

        <h3>Endocrine pathways</h3>
        <p>In response to cold, the hypothalamus increases the release of TRH leading to an increased production of thyroid hormone. Similarly, an increase in CRH stimulates the adrenal glands to release more cortisol which in turn influences metabolism and energy production.</p>
        
        <h3>Behavioural responses</h3>
        <p>As we become aware of a change in the difference between the set-point and our current temperature, whether it be due to an environmental change or a set-point change, we seek out warmth and change our clothing.</p>

        <h1>Disorders of temperature regulation</h1>
        <p>There is two principle categories of an increased body temperature, namely <b>fever</b> or <b>pyrexia</b> and <b>hypothermia</b>. While there are multiple definitions of both, here we take fever to mean those increases in body temeprature caused by an increased hypothalamic set-point, while hypothermia is taken to mean any increase in body temperature not caused by a change in set-point.</p>
        <p>Within fever, one may classify the severity:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Low-grade: 37.3 C to 38.0 C</li>
            <li>Moderate-grade: 38.1 C to 39.0 C</li>
            <li>High-grade: 39.1 C to 41 C</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The aetiology then, of a fever, can be categorised as the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Infectious</li>
            <li>Neoplastic</li>
            <li>Inflammatory (incl. rheumatic, non-rheumatic, and drug-related)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Other origins of fever may include <b>fever after brain injury</b> where a hypothalamic laesion may cause thermic dysregulation; and <b>endocrine fever</b> where an increase in thyroid hormones increase the set-point.</p>

        <p>Based on duration, fevers can be broadly categorised in acute <b>(less than 4 days)</b> or non-acute <b>(more than 4 days)</b>. An acute fever in adults is highly likely to be infectious. </p>

        <h1>Consequences of fever and hypothermia</h1>

        <h2>Metabolic effects</h2>
        <p>With a febrile state we see a <b>10% raise in metaolic rate per 1 C increase in body temperature</b>, naturally this demands an increase oxygen demand, increased heart rate and increased respiratory rate. The type of metabolism changes too, as <b>protein and fat metabolism is increased</b> and <b>glucose metabolism is decreased</b>. At the same time <b>immune function is enhanced</b> and <b>normal growth of pathogens is disrupted</b>.</p>

        <h2>Other effects</h2>
        <p>At the same time, we see <b>acute neurologic and cognitive dysfunction</b>, especially of <b>cerebellar origin</b> in extreme fevers and heatstroke. At the same time we see <b>hypotension</b>, <b>high cardiac output</b> with an EEG showing <b>T-wave abnormalities, QT and ST changes and conduction defects</b>. Furthermore, in <b>extreme fever</b> we might see <b>increased liver enzymes</b>. Lastly, with increased temperature we see <b>decreased GFR</b> and <b>decreased clotting ability</b>.</p>
