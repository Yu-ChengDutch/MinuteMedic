        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The <b>pleural space</b> is a <b>potential space</b> (i.e., an anatomical space that doesn't exist under normal circumstances) which surrounds each lung. Under normal circumstances, the <b>parietal pleural capillaries</b> secrete <b>pleural fluid</b> at a mere <b>0.6 mL per kg per hour</b> which is then promptly cleared by lymphatic absorption. In the end, this leaves a mere 5-15 millilitres of fluid in the potential space, which helps to maintain a functional vacuum.</p>
        <p>If too much fluid accumulates, which is essentially what pleural effusion is, then that can impair inspiration:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>by upsetting the functional vacuum</li>
            <li>by hydrostatically increasing resistance against lung expansion</li>

        </ol>

        <p>This then potentially results in a fully, or partially, collapsed lung.</p>
        <p>When thinking about plural effusion, beware that there are various fluids that can accumulate:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Hydrothorax: serous fluid</li>
            <li>Hemothorax: blood</li>
            <li>Pyothorax or pleural empyema: pus</li>
            <li>Chylothorax: chyle</li>
            <li>Urinothorax/coprothorax: urine or feces</li>

        </ol>

        <p>When unspecified, assume that <b>pleural effusion refers to hydrothorax</b>. There is also the phenomenon of <b>hydropneumothorax</b> which is the simultaneous occurance of pneumo- and hydrothorax, which we'll discuss at the end.</p>

        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <p>Which is closer to the lung?</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">
            <li data-answer="wrong">Parietal pleura</li>

        <h2>Pathophysiological typology</h2>
        <p>While one can divide pleural effusion based on the actual contents of that effusion, like we did in the introductory section, we may similarly divide the types of effusion based on the <b>pathophysiological mechanism</b>.</p>

        <h3>Transudative effusion</h3>
        <p>This type of pleural effusion develops when there is either <b>excessive production of pleural fluid</b> or <b>reduced resorption capacity</b>.</p>
        <p>A very common cause is <b>congestive heart failure</b> which then leads to oedema in the lungs, which traverses the pleura. Essentially anything that causes <b>oedema</b> could cause transudative pleural effusions: CHF, liver cirrhosis, myxedemia etc.</p>
        <p>Another common cause is <b>nephrotic syndrome</b> which leads to the loss of massive amounts of <b>albumin</b> through the urine, leading to <b>hypoalbuminemia</b> and thus <b>reduced colloid osmotic pressure</b>. This means the fluid can't be held intravascularly, which causes a fluid shift <b>from the vessels into the interstitial space</b> because of the hydrostatic pressure from the other side is lacking.</p>

        <h3>Exudative effusion</h3>
        <p>This type of pleural effusion develops when the pleura or vessel is damaged, whether it be <b>trauma, infection, or malignancy</b>. That then, allows foreign liquids to enter the pleural space.</p>
        <p>A recently proven cause are <b>pulmonary embolisms</b> where the platelet-rich blood clots stimulate the release of <b>cytokines or inflammatory mediators</b> which in turn increased <b>permeability of capillaries</b> iin the lung.</p>

        <p>Almost all non-hydro types of pleural effusions are exudative. The origin is found by testing the fluid:</p>

        <p>Hemothorax: possible after cardiac surgery or trauma, shows with <b>increased RBCs</b> and visually red.</p>
        <p>Malignancy: most often caused by <b>lung, breast and lymph node cancer</b>, it causes <b>low glucose</b> (may also be caused by <b>empyema, bacterial infections and rheumatoid pleuritis</b>), and when expected, is an indication for <b>cytology</b>, and then, if the suspection remains, <b>thorascopy or needle biopsy</b>.</p>
        <p>Infection: most often caused by <b>bacterial pneumonia</b>, it causes <b>low glucose</b> and is reason for gram-staining and culture. If <b>tuberculosis</b> is possible, a Ziehl-Neelsen stain or PCR may be done.</p>

        <p>If high amylase is found, that means that there is a connection the digestive system: <b>esophageal rupture, pancreatic pleural effusion or cancer</b>.</p>

        <h1>Diagnosis</h1>
        <p>A pleural effusion is confirmed using a <b>chest X-ray</b>, which shows detectable signs from <b>300 mL onwards</b>.</p>
        <p>On phsyical examination, it shows <b>decreased breathing movements, dullness to percussion, diminished breath sounds, decreased vocal resonance and fremitus and pleural friction rub</b>. Above the effusion, the lung is compressed, and hence may show <b>bronchial reathing sounds and egophony (i.e., voice sounds)</b>.</p>

        <img src="Images/image_pleural_effusion.png">

        <p>Imaging shows an <b>area of whiteness</b> on a standard posteroanterior chest X-ray. Side-laying X-rays can show an even smaller amount of liquid. </p>

        <h2>Thoracentesis</h2>
        <p>Both treatment and diagnostic method, a <b>thoracentesis</b> is almost always indicated. The only exception is <b>CHF</b> when it is symmetric and without chest pain or fever, for whom <b>diuresis</b> may be more readily indicated, unless the effusions still persist for more than three days.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the needle is inserted through the <b>back of the chest wall, in the 6th, 7th or 8th intercostal space on the midaxillary line</b>. The use of ultrasound is nowadays standard. The fluid may be evaludated for various things.</p>

        <h2>Light's criteria</h2>
        <p>Used to separate between transudate (either heightened hydrostatic pressure, or lowered osmotic pressure; but without changes in vascular permeability) and exsudative (inflammation or increased vascular permeability), the criteria are used. These say that <b>pleural liquid is likely to be exudative if one of these exists:</b></p>

        <ol>

            <li>ratio of protein in pleural fluid to serum exceeds 0.5</li>
            <li>ratio of LDH in pleural fluid to serum exceeds 0.6</li>
            <li>absolute LDH in pleural fluid is 0.6 times the normal limit</li>
        
        </ol>

        <p>This means that if the protein and/or LDH in the <b>pleural fluid are high</b> (normally above 30), then it is <b>exudative</b>. This is because in the transudative case, there is still a filter, and in the exudative case that filter is broken. If Light's criteria do not match up with the suspected cause, then <b>albumin</b> is the next step with the same reasoning.</p>

        <h2>Colour</h2>
        <p>Colour of the liquid can also say something:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Purulent fluid: empyema (putrid odour means an <b>anaerobic empyema</b>)</li>
            <li>Milky fluid: chylothorax</li>
            <li>Bloody fluid: usually trauma</li>
            <li>Straw-coloured fluid with ammonia smell: urinothorax</li>
            <li>Food particles: oesophageal rupture</li>
            <li>Black fluid: aspergillus or melanoma</li>

        </ol>

        <h1>Hydropneumothorax</h1>

        <p>The combination of air and fluid <b>within the pleural space</b> may occurr for various reasons:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Iatrogenic: introduction of air during aspiration of pleural effusion</li>
            <li>Infectious: gas-forming organism</li>
            <li>Traumatic: thoracic trauma</li>

        </ol>

        <p>It then presents with the 4 Ss:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Straight line (on X-ray)</li>
            <li>Shifting dullness</li>
            <li>Splash</li>
            <li>Sound of coin</li>

        </ol>

        <img src="Images/image_hydropneumo.png">

        <p>The x-ray shows the straight line that indicates the fluid level, and is pathognomic for hydropneumothorax. Treatment then, consists of <b>intercostal drainage (ICD)</b> of both fluid and air, and treatment of the underlying condition.</p>
