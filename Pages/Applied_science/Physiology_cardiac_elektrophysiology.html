        <h1>Cardiac pacemaker</h1>

        <p>The heart generates its own rhythm, by using <b>pacemaker cells</b> (a type of cardiomyocytes) that generate <b>cardiac action potentials</b> which control the rate of contraction of the cardiac muscle. There are multiple parts of the pacemaker system that can generate their own rhythm, but since the <b>Sinoatrial Node (SA node)</b> has the fastest rhythm, it <b>depolarises the others before they have a chance to generate their own rhythm</b>. While the rhythm for the SA node is ~100 bpm, the secondary pacemakers have the following rhythms:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>AV node: 40-60 bpm</li>
            <li>Bundle of His: ??? bpm</li>
            <li>Left/right bundle branches: 30-40 bpm</li>
            <li>Purkinje fibers: 30-40 bpm</li>

        </ol>

        <p>When the SA node fails, this means that there are at least 3 stages of back-up generators to take over the role of pacemaker. </p>
        
        <p>While the entire system can keep pulsing without any input from the autonomous nervous system, the actual rate of firing is constantly modified through it. Central control then, takes place through the <b>Nucleus Tractus Sollitarius (NTS)</b> within the <b>Medulla</b>. In turn,, this nucleus is connected to the <b>N. Vagus</b> which innervates the heart <b>parasympathetically</b>: <b>Right vagus nerve to the SA node</b>, and <b>left vagus nerve to AV node</b>. Parasympathetic stimulation then is negatively chronotropic, negatively inotropic and negatively dromotoropic. For sympathetic innervation, the effects are reverse.</p>

        <h2>Physiology</h2>
        
        <p>Strangely, there are 3 phases to cardiac pacemaking but they are named/numbered in a normal fashion.</p>

        <h3>Phase 4: Pacemaker potential</h3>

        <p>In <b>normal cells</b> a resting potential at -60 to -70 mV is caused by <b>continous leaking of potassium ions</b> through the membrane. However, in cardiac cells two things occur:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Rate of leak of potassium slows down over time</li>
            <li>Sodium slowly leaks inwards</li>

        </ol>

        <p>This causes a constant, weak current called the <b>funny current</b>. Eventually, this gets to <b>-40mV</b> at which point threshold is reached and an action potential is generated.</p>

        <h3>Phase 0: Upstroke</h3>

        <p>While normal cells rely on <b>fast sodium channels</b> for their action potentials, cardiac cells do not have these. Instead, they rely on <b>slow calcium channels</b> to create a <b>slow spike in current</b>. Eventually, this leads to a reversal of membrane potential at <b>+10 mV</b>.</p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Repolarisation</h3>

        <p>The potential reversal triggers the opening of <b>potassium leak channels</b> which causes <b>repolarisation</b>. At the same time <b>calcium and sodium channels are inactivated</b>. Then, two active pumps restore balance <b>first, sodium-calcium exchanger (i.e., calcium out, sodium in)</b> and then <b>sodium-potassium pump (i.e., sodium out, potassium in)</b>. After that, the cell is essentially reset.</p>

        <h1>Cardiac conduction system</h1>

        <p>The myocytes of the heart form a <b>functional syncytium</b>, with a syncytium being a "unified cell" (like, for example, a muscle fibre). However, while in skeletal muscle, being a "true syncytium", the potential may only spread within a single fibre, within cardiac tissue <b>all cells are elektrofunctionally connected</b> which makes it so that current can spread in every direction. Hence why it is called a functional synctytium.</p>

        <p>Now, the potential arrises in the <b>SA node</b> from where it <b>immediately contracts the atria</b>. It then arrives at the <b>AV node</b>, where it is held up for a little while, which gives the ventricles time to fill. It passes the <b>bundle of His</b> and moves on to the <b>Purkinje fibers and left posterior bundle</b> which then contracts the ventricles. In order to maximise efficiency, <b>cardiac apex contracts before the rest</b> so that blood is squeezed towards the exit. </p>

        <p>An important mechanism of error prevention is the aforementioned <b>inactivation of sodium and calcium channels</b> so that no tetanic/sustained contraction may occur.  </p>

        <h1>Cardiac myocytes</h1>

        <p>The cardiac myocyte rests at <b>-90 mV</b> and polarises to <b>+50 mV</b>.</p>

        <h2>Phase 4: Resting phase</h2>

        <p>In the resting phase, a <b>constant outflow of potassium</b> keeps the voltage at <b>-90 mV</b>.</p>

        <h2>Phase 0: Upstroke</h2>

        <p>Neighbouring cells (see: functional synctytium) let in <b>sodium and calcium ions</b> which lifts the voltage from -90 mV to <b>-70 mV</b> after which a certain threshold is reached. This is sufficinet to open the <b>voltage-gated sodium channels</b>, which quickly brings the cell to <b>+50 mV</b>.</p>

        <h2>Phase 1: Repolarisation</h2>

        <p>When peak voltage is reached, <b>potassium channels open</b> which then decreases the voltage again.</p>

        <h2>Phase 2: Plateau</h2>

        <p>As the cell slowly repolarises, the <b>voltage-gated calcium channels</b> open up into the cell. This then creates a balance.</p>

        <h2>Phase 3: Continued repolarisation</h2>

        <p>Eventually the calcium-channels close again, leaving <b>outward potassium flow</b> as the only flow. This then causes <b>rapid depolarisation</b> which brings the charge back to -90 mV, which closes the <u>voltage-gated potassium channel</u>, after which only the <u>original</u> potassium channel is left and we're again in phae 0.</p>
