        <h1>Introduction to Liver Function Tests</h1>
        <h2>Anatomy and Physiology of the Liver</h2>
        <p>The <strong>liver</strong> is a vital organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, just beneath the diaphragm. 
        It is divided into two major lobes and is primarily composed of hepatocytes. These cells perform a variety of critical functions including 
        metabolism, detoxification, protein synthesis, and bile production.</p>
        
        <p>The liver receives dual blood supply: oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery and nutrient-rich blood from the portal vein. 
        This unique vascularization supports its extensive metabolic activity. Blood from the liver drains into the inferior vena cava via the hepatic veins.</p>

        <h3>Functions of the Liver Relevant to Testing</h3>
        <p>The liver’s biochemical activities can be grouped into the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Metabolic regulation</strong> (glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism)</li>
            <li><strong>Excretory function</strong> (bilirubin and bile acids)</li>
            <li><strong>Synthetic function</strong> (albumin, clotting factors)</li>
            <li><strong>Detoxification</strong> (ammonia, drugs, toxins)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Derangements in these functions are reflected in a set of blood tests collectively known as <strong>liver function tests</strong> (LFTs). 
        These tests do not all measure the same aspect of liver function, and some are better thought of as markers of liver injury rather than function per se.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">
            <strong>Mnemonic:</strong> Think of the liver as a <strong>MAPS</strong> center: <strong>M</strong>etabolism, <strong>A</strong>lbumin synthesis, <strong>P</strong>rotein processing, and <strong>S</strong>ecretion.

    <!-- Begin ALAT block -->
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Alanine Aminotransferase (ALAT/ALT)</h1>
        <h2>Physiology</h2>
        <p><strong>ALT</strong> is an intracellular enzyme found predominantly in hepatocytes. Its physiological role is in amino acid metabolism, 
        specifically catalyzing the reversible transfer of an amino group from alanine to α-ketoglutarate to form pyruvate and glutamate.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>In hepatocellular injury, ALT leaks into the bloodstream. Because ALT is more liver-specific than AST, it is a sensitive marker for liver cell injury.
        Elevations in ALT are seen in viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, ischemic hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. It is usually higher than AST in non-alcoholic causes of hepatocellular injury.</p>

        <h2>Clinical Use</h2>
        <p>ALT is used to detect hepatocellular injury. In chronic liver disease, ALT levels may normalize despite ongoing fibrosis, especially in cirrhosis,
        due to a reduction in viable hepatocyte mass.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">
            <strong>Mnemonic:</strong> <strong>ALT = "A Liver Target"</strong> — Think of ALT as the enzyme that directly signals hepatocyte injury.
        </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>ASAT (Aspartate Aminotransferase)</h1>
        <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
        <p><strong>ASAT</strong>, also known as AST, is an enzyme found in a variety of tissues, including the <strong>liver</strong>, <strong>cardiac muscle</strong>, <strong>skeletal muscle</strong>, and <strong>kidneys</strong>. Like ALAT, ASAT catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to alpha-ketoglutarate, producing oxaloacetate and glutamate.</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
        <p>Because ASAT is <strong>less liver-specific</strong> than ALAT, elevated levels must be interpreted carefully. While liver injury (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis) can cause ASAT elevation, so can conditions such as <strong>myocardial infarction</strong>, <strong>muscle trauma</strong>, and <strong>hemolysis</strong>. In liver disease, a particularly <strong>high ASAT/ALAT ratio</strong> (>2) is often associated with <strong>alcoholic hepatitis</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
        <p>ASAT is best interpreted in the context of other enzymes. For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>High ASAT + High ALAT</strong>: Acute hepatocellular injury</li>
            <li><strong>High ASAT/ALAT ratio</strong>: Consider alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis</li>
            <li><strong>High ASAT + normal ALAT</strong>: Suggests muscle or cardiac origin</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="mnemonic">
            <h3>Mnemonic: "S = Systemic"</h3>
            <p>Remember that <strong>ASAT</strong> is found in more <strong>systemic tissues</strong> than ALAT—this helps you recall that its elevation may reflect extrahepatic damage.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">

    <div class="explanation-card">
    <h1>AF (Alkaline Phosphatase)</h1>
    <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
    <p><strong>Alkaline Phosphatase (AF)</strong> is an enzyme found in the membranes of many tissues, particularly in the <strong>liver</strong> (bile canaliculi), <strong>bone</strong>, <strong>placenta</strong>, and <strong>intestines</strong>. It functions best at an alkaline pH and plays a key role in <strong>dephosphorylation</strong> of various molecules.</p>
    <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
    <p>In the liver, AF is particularly associated with the biliary epithelium. Hence, an elevation in AF is a hallmark of <strong>cholestasis</strong>, both intrahepatic and extrahepatic. Elevation can also occur with <strong>biliary obstruction</strong> (e.g., gallstones, tumors), <strong>primary sclerosing cholangitis</strong>, or <strong>primary biliary cholangitis</strong>.</p>
    <p>Extrahepatic causes of elevated AF include <strong>bone disease</strong> (e.g., Paget’s disease, osteoblastic metastases), <strong>pregnancy</strong>, and certain malignancies. Therefore, interpretation must be done in context, often using <strong>GGT</strong> to confirm hepatic origin.</p>
    <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
    <p>
        AF is especially useful in distinguishing <strong>cholestatic</strong> from <strong>hepatocellular</strong> patterns of liver injury. In a cholestatic pattern, AF is disproportionately elevated compared to transaminases.
    </p>
    <div class="mnemonic">
        <h3>Mnemonic: "AF = Alkaline Flow"</h3>
        <p>Remember AF rises when <strong>flow of bile</strong> is impaired — think of “alkaline flow” being blocked in biliary obstruction or cholestasis.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
    <h1>Question 7</h1>

    <div class="explanation-card">
    <h1>GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)</h1>
    <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
    <p><strong>Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)</strong> is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in <strong>glutathione metabolism</strong> and <strong>amino acid transport</strong>. It is found in the <strong>liver</strong>, <strong>kidneys</strong>, <strong>pancreas</strong>, and <strong>intestines</strong>, but clinically it is most relevant as a marker of <strong>hepatobiliary injury</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
    <p>
        GGT is often elevated in <strong>cholestasis</strong>, <strong>biliary tract disease</strong>, and <strong>alcoholic liver disease</strong>. Because GGT is highly inducible, it is also increased by enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, barbiturates) and <strong>chronic alcohol use</strong>. GGT elevation alone does not confirm liver damage, but in combination with elevated AF, it strongly suggests a <strong>hepatic source</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
    <p>
        GGT is primarily used to confirm the hepatic origin of elevated AF. It is also helpful in screening for <strong>alcoholic liver disease</strong>, where GGT can be disproportionately high. However, GGT is <strong>nonspecific</strong> and can be elevated in a variety of conditions without liver injury.
    </p>
    <div class="mnemonic">
        <h3>Mnemonic: “GGT = Good for Getting Truth”</h3>
        <p>When AF is elevated, use GGT to get the <strong>truth</strong> about whether the source is the <strong>liver</strong> — if both are up, it’s hepatic; if only AF is high, suspect bone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
  <h1>Bilirubin</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p><strong>Bilirubin</strong> is a yellow pigment derived from the breakdown of <strong>heme</strong>, primarily from senescent red blood cells. It exists in two major forms in the bloodstream: <strong>unconjugated (indirect)</strong> and <strong>conjugated (direct)</strong>. Unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and transported bound to albumin to the liver, where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid by <strong>UGT1A1</strong> (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), making it water-soluble for excretion into bile.</p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    Hyperbilirubinemia results from increased production, decreased uptake/conjugation, or impaired excretion. These processes can be classified as:
    <strong>Pre-hepatic</strong> (e.g., hemolysis), 
    <strong>Hepatic</strong> (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis, Gilbert syndrome), or 
    <strong>Post-hepatic</strong> (e.g., biliary obstruction).
  </p>
  <p>
    Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia indicates <strong>intrahepatic cholestasis</strong> or <strong>biliary obstruction</strong>, while unconjugated points toward <strong>hemolysis</strong> or impaired conjugation (e.g., Gilbert, Crigler-Najjar).
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    Measurement of total and direct bilirubin allows calculation of the indirect fraction. This distinction is essential in differentiating causes of jaundice. Rapidly rising conjugated bilirubin in neonates is dangerous due to potential <strong>kernicterus</strong> and always pathological.
  </p>

  <div class="mnemonic">
    <h3>Mnemonic: "Pre-Liver, Liver, Post-Liver"</h3>
    <p>Think of bilirubin elevation in a flow: hemolysis before the liver, liver diseases in the middle, and obstruction after. Helps determine the type of jaundice quickly.</p>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h1>Albumin</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Albumin</strong> is the most abundant plasma protein, synthesized exclusively by the <strong>liver</strong>. It plays a central role in maintaining <strong>oncotic pressure</strong> and acts as a carrier protein for hormones, fatty acids, and drugs. 
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    Hypoalbuminemia can occur in <strong>chronic liver disease</strong> (e.g., cirrhosis), <strong>malnutrition</strong>, <strong>protein-losing enteropathy</strong>, or <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>. In liver disease, low albumin reflects impaired synthetic function, which is a marker of disease severity.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    Serum albumin is used to assess <strong>chronic hepatic insufficiency</strong> and nutritional status. It is also part of prognostic scoring systems like <strong>Child-Pugh</strong> and <strong>MELD</strong>. Its long half-life (~20 days) means changes reflect long-term trends.
  </p>

  <div class="mnemonic">
    <h3>Mnemonic: "ALB = A Long Baseline"</h3>
    <p>Albumin reflects <strong>long-term</strong> liver function — it drops slowly but surely in chronic disease, giving a baseline of hepatic capacity.</p>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h1>INR / PT (International Normalized Ratio / Prothrombin Time)</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>prothrombin time (PT)</strong> measures the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways, particularly factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, and X — all synthesized by the liver. The <strong>INR</strong> is a standardized form of PT used internationally.
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    An elevated INR indicates <strong>deficient hepatic synthesis</strong> of clotting factors and is a sensitive marker of liver synthetic function, especially in <strong>acute liver failure</strong>. It is also elevated in <strong>vitamin K deficiency</strong>, warfarin use, and <strong>disseminated intravascular coagulation</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    PT/INR is essential in assessing <strong>acute and chronic liver disease</strong>. A worsening INR in the absence of anticoagulants may indicate progressing liver dysfunction. It is a key component of prognostic systems such as the <strong>MELD score</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="mnemonic">

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h1>Ammonium (NH₄⁺)</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Ammonium</strong> is a nitrogenous waste product primarily generated from protein metabolism in the gut and peripheral tissues. It is highly toxic and converted in the liver via the <strong>urea cycle</strong> into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys.
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    In liver dysfunction, especially <strong>acute liver failure</strong> or <strong>cirrhosis with portal hypertension</strong>, the urea cycle is impaired leading to <strong>hyperammonemia</strong>. Elevated ammonium crosses the blood-brain barrier, contributing to <strong>hepatic encephalopathy</strong>, characterized by confusion, asterixis, and coma in severe cases.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    Serum ammonium levels help assess the severity of hepatic encephalopathy and guide treatment (e.g., lactulose, rifaximin). However, levels must be interpreted with caution as they can be influenced by sample handling and other systemic factors.
  </p>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h1>Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>LDH</strong> is an intracellular enzyme involved in the reversible conversion of lactate to pyruvate during anaerobic metabolism. It is present in many tissues, including the liver, heart, muscles, and red blood cells.
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    Elevated serum LDH indicates cellular injury or death but is non-specific. In liver disease, it may rise with acute hepatocellular damage (e.g., viral hepatitis) or liver ischemia. It also increases in hemolysis, malignancy, and other tissue injuries.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    LDH is used as an ancillary marker rather than a primary liver function test. Its isoenzyme pattern may help distinguish between liver and other tissue sources.
  </p>

  <h1>Haptoglobin</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Haptoglobin</strong> is a plasma glycoprotein produced by the liver that binds free hemoglobin released during intravascular hemolysis, preventing kidney damage and iron loss.
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    In hemolytic anemias, free hemoglobin increases in plasma and haptoglobin binds it, leading to decreased measurable serum haptoglobin. Thus, low haptoglobin is a sensitive marker of hemolysis. In liver disease, synthesis can also be reduced, complicating interpretation.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    Measurement of haptoglobin helps differentiate hemolytic anemia from other causes of anemia. Low haptoglobin with elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin suggests hemolysis.

  <h1>Ferritin (in Liver Disease)</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Ferritin</strong> is the intracellular protein that stores and releases iron in a controlled manner. Serum ferritin correlates with total body iron stores but also acts as an acute phase reactant.
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    Elevated ferritin is seen in iron overload disorders such as <strong>hemochromatosis</strong>, chronic liver disease, inflammation, and malignancy. In liver disease, ferritin may rise due to both iron accumulation and inflammation.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    Ferritin measurement aids in diagnosing iron overload syndromes and monitoring treatment. In liver disease, interpreting ferritin requires consideration of the inflammatory status.
  </p>

  <div class="mnemonic">
    <h3>Mnemonic: "Ferritin = Fire Alarm"</h3>

  <h1>Ceruloplasmin</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Ceruloplasmin</strong> is a copper-binding plasma protein synthesized in the liver. It functions as a ferroxidase enzyme, facilitating iron metabolism by oxidizing Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ for incorporation into transferrin.
  </p>

  <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2>
  <p>
    Decreased ceruloplasmin is a hallmark of <strong>Wilson’s disease</strong>, a genetic disorder of copper metabolism causing hepatic and neurologic damage. Ceruloplasmin is also an acute phase reactant, increasing in inflammation.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2>
  <p>
    Low serum ceruloplasmin supports the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease, especially combined with elevated urinary copper and clinical features.

  <h1>Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)</h1>
  <h2>Physiology and Role</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Alpha-fetoprotein</strong> is a fetal plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and liver. After birth, its levels drop rapidly and remain low in healthy adults.</p> 
    <h2>Pathophysiology and Clinical Implications</h2> 
    <p> Elevated AFP is a tumor marker for <strong>hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</strong> and certain germ cell tumors. It can also rise in active hepatitis and regenerative nodules but to a lesser degree. </p> 
    <h2>Diagnostic Use</h2> 
    <p> AFP measurement is used for surveillance in patients at risk for HCC, especially those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B/C. Rising AFP in these patients warrants imaging for tumor detection. </p>

        <h3>Mnemonic: "AFP = A Fetal Protein"</h3> 
        <p>AFP normally drops after birth; a rise in adults signals liver cancer or regeneration.</p>
