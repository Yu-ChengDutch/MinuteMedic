        <h1>Acid-base homeostasis</h1>
        <p>Proteins are complex three-dimensional structures. When exposed to heat or varying degrees of pH, they may denature (i.e., have their structure disrupted). Now, when this happens, the enzymes and ion gates we're talking about stop functioning. To prevent this, there are three lines of defense:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Chemical: various chemical buffers make the system more resitant to pH changes</li>
            <li>Respiratory component: a <b>rapid</b> means of control by blowing off carbon dioxide, and thus decreasing carbonic acid (NL: Koolzuur)</li>
            <li>Metabolic component: a <b>slow</b> means of control through the renal system</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Central control is regulated through the <b>central chemoreceptors</b> in the medulla oblongata which check the carbon dioxide and pH in the <b>cerebrospinal fluid</b>. They then pass on their information to the respiratory centers in the <b>medulla oblongata and pons</b>.</p>

        <h2>Respiratory control</h2>
        <p>A rise of pCO2 in the arterial blood plasma above <b>5.3 kPa or 40 mmHg</b> will cause reflexive increase in rate and depth of breathing. A change in breathing may be primary to acidosis/alkalosis, but may also arise to compensate a primarily metabolic problem.</p>

        <h2>Metabolic control</h2>
        <p>The <b>renal tubular cells</b> of the <b>distal convoluted tubules</b> are sensitive to plasma pH. The metabolism of these cells then (paradoxically) produces CO2, which falls apart into H+ and HCO3-. This is where the control happens: when pH is high, H+ ions are retained but when pH is low the HCO3- ions are retained; while the non-retained ion is always excreted through the urine. In the case that H+ is retained, it binds to the HCO3- already present to form H2CO3. As metabolism generally produces more acids than bases, urine is usually acidic.</p>

        <h2>Chemical note</h2>
        <p>To calculate the pH of the extracellular fluid (ECF), the <b>Hendrson-Hasselbalch equation</b> is used. In the original form, this uses HCO3- and H2CO3. However, since the partial pressure of CO2 is easier to messure and directly proportional to the partial pressure of CO2, it is used instead. </p>

        <h3>Base excess/deficit</h3>
        <p>Defined as <b>the amount of strong acid that must be added to each liter of fully oxygenated blood to bring it back to a pH of 7.4</b>, the base excess represents an access or deficit of HCO3- present in the blood. Since it is the metabolic control that takes care of bicarbonate, a base excess outside of the normale range (<b>-2 to 2</b>) indicates a metabolic origin or compensation.</p>
        <p>A high base excess, being above 2, indicates a metabolic alkalosis or renal compensation. A low base excess, meaning less than -2, indicates a renal acidosis or renal compensation.</p>

        <h3>Anion gap</h3>
        <p>The anion gap is the difference between cations (i.e., positively charged ions) and anions (i.e., negatively charged ions) in serum, plasma or urine. It is usually calculated based on two cations (<b>Sodium and Potassium</b>) and two anions (<b>Chloride and Bicarbonate</b>), of which potassium may be left out as the concentrations are relatively low. An anion gap essentially indicates the <b>amount of unmeasured ions</b>, and thus the solution of different substances in the blood. As a high anion gap indicates <b>an overrepresentation of cations (acids) in the blood</b>.</p>

        <h1>Clinical entities</h1>
        <h2>Acidosis</h2>
        <p>Meaning a pH that is below 7.35, often presents with symptoms related to the <b>nervous system</b>. These systems may include <b>headaches, confusion, tiredness, tremors, sleepiness, tremor</b> and eventually, <b>coma</b>.</p>

        <h3>Metabolic acidosis</h3>
        <p>Essentailly, this has three aetiologies:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Increased acid production</li>
            <li>Loss of bicarbonate</li>
            <li>Reduced renal ability to secrete acids</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A specific symptom is <b>Kussmaul respirations</b>, which is an attempt at respiratory compensation.</p>

        <p>This is also where the anion gap starts playing a role. This results in the following diagnostic guides:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>High anion gap: <b>too many acids</b>, often lactic or ketoacidosis. Rarely casued by toxins or kidney failure (subsequent retention of sulfates, phosphates, urate etc.), massive rhabdomyalisis</li>
            <li>Normal anion gap: <b>normal amount of acids</b>, thus such an acidosis is caused by a base-drop (GI loss, renal loss etc.)</li>
            <li>Low anion gap: <b>low amount of acids</b> caused by <b>hypoalbuminemia</b>. As its loss results in the retention of negatively charged ions. <b>NB: may indicate Multiple Myeloma (MM).</b></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Respiratory acidosis</h3>
        <p>This is always caused by <b>hypoventilation</b> which increases the carbon dioxide content in the blood, and consequently the carbonic acid concentration; leading to hypercapnia. Commong causes central respiratoyr depression (i.e., cerebral disease, drugs), neuromuscular hypoventilation or airway obstruction.</p>

        <h2>Alkalosis</h2>
        <p>Here, the pH is elevated above the normal range, i.e., above 7,45. </p>
        
        <h3>Metabolic alkalosis</h3>
        <p>This may be divided in three categories:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Chloride-responsive: loss of hydrogen ions (vomiting), posthypercapnia (because metabolic is slower than respiratory), cystic fibrosis (excessive loss of sodium chloride insweat)</li>
            <li>Chloride-indeterminate: Milk-alkali syndrome (i.e., hypercalcaemia, often after ingestion of supplements)</li>
            <li>Chloride-resistant: Hyperaldosteronism, hypokalaemia</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Respiratory alkalosis</h2>
        <p>Hyperventilation causes increased blowing off CO2, hence decreasing pCO2 and creating a hypocapnic situation in which blood becomes basic. Common causes included stress, pulmonary disorders, thermal insults, salicylate poisoning, fever, hyperventilation, vocal cord paralysis and liver disease.</p>

        <h1>Diagnosis and rule of thumb</h1>

        <p>Following a British ALS guide, the rules to follow may be the following:</p>

        <p>Step 1: <b>pH</b> -> Is the patient acidaemic (below 7.35) or alkalaemic (above 7.45)?</p>
        <p>Step 2: <b>pCO2</b> -> Is the patient hypercapnic (pCO2 above 6; respiratory acidosis) or hypocapnic (pCO2 below 4.7; respiratory alkalosis)?</p>
        <p>Step 3: <b>base</b> -> Is there a base excess or bicarbonate reduced (lower than -2 mmol/L or 22 mmol/L respectively; metabolic acidosis) or increased (above 2 mmol/L or 26 mmol/L; metabolic alkalosis)?</p>

        <p>Importantly, the primary cause is always consistent with the pH, meaning a situation of acidaemia with hypercapnia and increase base excess is primarily respiratory and metabolically compensated.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, follow the following image: <br></p>
