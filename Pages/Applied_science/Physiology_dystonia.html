            Muscle tone is a complex and dynamic state that describes the tension in a relaxed muscle or the resistance
            felt by
            an examiner during passive joint movement when muscles are at rest. It is an adaptive function of the
            neuromotor
            apparatus, essential for movement and postural control. Abnormalities in muscle tone can manifest as
            hypertonia,
            which includes spasticity and rigidity, or other disorders such as dystonia and paratonia.

        <h1>Spasticity</h1>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Spasticity is a motor disorder characterised by a <b>velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes
                (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks</b>, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex,
            often as a component of an upper motor neuron syndrome. More recently, it has been redefined as
            <b>"disordered
                sensory-motor control, resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion, presenting as intermittent or
                sustained
                involuntary activation of muscles"</b>. A broader definition describes it as "involuntary muscle
            hyperactivity in the presence of central paresis".
        </p>
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>
            Spasticity can be classified as <b>'phasic'</b> or <b>'tonic'</b>, based on the predominant involvement of
            dynamic or static components of muscle stretch reflexes, respectively.
        </p>
        <h2>Aetiology</h2>
        <p>
            Spasticity results from an <b>upper motor neuron lesion</b>. This includes <b>cortical lesions</b> involving
            corticoreticular fibres, leading to unopposed facilitatory action of medial reticulospinal tract (RST), and
            <b>spinal cord lesions</b> (myelopathy) impacting descending long tracts.
        </p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>
            The underlying mechanisms of spasticity involve both spinal and supraspinal influences, as well as sensory
            feedback and non-neural factors:
            <br> - <b>Spinal Influence</b>: Can arise from increased excitation or decreased inhibition. This includes
            enhanced
            fusimotor drive, denervation hypersensitivity, axonal sprouting, hyperexcitability of alpha motor neurons,
            and
            excitation of interneurons. Altered spinal inhibitory circuitry plays a role, with decreased presynaptic
            inhibition of Ia afferents, reduced disynaptic reciprocal Ia afferent inhibition, and diminished Ib afferent
            mediated inhibition.
            <br> - <b>Supraspinal Influence</b>: Normally, human muscle tone is balanced by inhibitory corticospinal
            tract (CST)
            and dorsal RST, and facilitatory medial RST and vestibulospinal tract (VST). Lesions disrupting these tracts
            lead to spasticity; for instance, cortical lesions cause spasticity due to involvement of corticoreticular
            fibres and unopposed medial RST activity.
            <br> - <b>Sensory Feedback</b>: Inadequate prediction of sensory consequences of movements, leading to
            co-contraction
            of antagonist muscles as a compensatory strategy for weakness.
            <br> - <b>Non-Neural Factors</b>: Changes in tissue viscoelastic properties, such as elastic stiffness and
            viscous
            damping, also contribute.
            <br> - <b>Clasp-Knife Phenomenon</b>: A sudden release of resistance during passive stretching, attributed
            to length
            dependency of spasticity and excitation of inhibitory group III and IV muscle afferents.
            <br> - <b>Clonus</b>: Regular, repetitive, rhythmic muscle contractions due to sudden, maintained stretch,
            potentially involving a stretch reflex-inverse stretch reflex sequence or hyperactivity of muscle spindles.
        </p>

        <h2>Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            Severity of muscle hyperactivity in spasticity can be described by the <b>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</b>,
            <b>Tardieu Scale</b>, and <b>Frequency of Spasms Score</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            A multimodal approach is recommended, with several treatments supported by <b>GRADE A evidence</b>:
            <br> - <b>Stretching Exercises</b>: Passive static/dynamic stretching can be an adjunctive therapy, with a
            total
            daily duration not exceeding 2.5 hours to avoid pain.
            <br> - <b>Static Stretching with Positioning Orthoses</b>: Their effectiveness in reducing wrist flexor
            spasticity is
            still uncertain, requiring more research.
            <br> - <b>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</b>: High-frequency TENS (100 Hz, >30
            min/session, >2
            weeks) can reduce lower extremity spasticity. Its effect on upper limb spasticity needs further
            investigation.
            <br> - <b>Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT)</b>: Radial ESWT can effectively reduce spasticity, with
            effects
            lasting up to 12 weeks, and repeating sessions within four weeks can maintain the effect.
            <br> - <b>Repetitive Peripheral Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS)</b>: May reduce spasticity in upper and lower
            extremities, but optimal protocol and duration are not yet established.
            <br> - <b>Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS)</b>: Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic
            stimulation
            (rTMS) of an unaffected hemisphere and/or anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of an
            affected
            hemisphere can reduce upper extremity spasticity.
            <br> - <b>Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT-A) Injection</b>: Considered essential for post-stroke spasticity
            management due to
            compelling evidence of its efficacy in reducing spasticity. It modulates cortical excitability and prevents
            contractures. Ultrasound (US)-guided injections improve safety and accuracy. Doses vary by product (e.g.,
            Botox®, Dysport®, Xeomin®), with intervals of 12 weeks or more recommended. Lower doses may be recommended
            in
            hot climates or for smaller muscle mass. While effective for muscle tone and hygiene, its contribution to
            functional recovery and spasticity-related pain is debated.
            <br> - <b>Dry Needling (DN)</b>: Useful as an adjuvant therapy, especially in lower extremities for
            short-term
            spasticity reduction (1 week), but not effective at 4 weeks.
            <br> - <b>Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB)</b>: An alternative for generalised, severe post-stroke spasticity that
            doesn't
            respond to conventional medical management, showing reduction in spastic hypertonia, muscle tone, pain, and
            improved quality of life.
            <br> - <b>Whole-Body Vibration Therapy (WBV)</b>: An adjunct treatment, particularly for individuals under
            60 years,
            at frequencies below 20 Hz for 10 minutes, especially when combined with other therapies.
            <br> - <b>Localized Muscle Vibration (LMV)</b>: A safe adjunct to conventional neurorehabilitation for
            reducing upper
            extremity spasticity (elbow and wrist), but more research is needed for lower limbs and optimal protocols.
            Oral medications are generally not supported by GRADE A evidence.

        <h1>Dystonia</h1>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Dystonia is a <b>movement disorder characterised by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing
                abnormal and often repetitive, movements, postures, or both</b>. Dystonic movements are typically
            <b>patterned, twisting, and may be tremulous</b>. It is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and
            associated with overflow muscle activation.
        </p>

        <h2>Phenomenological Spectrum</h2>
        <p>
            Dystonia can be characterized by its features across time, space distribution, and body state's impact:
            <br> - <b>Time</b>:
            <br> - <b>Rhythmicity</b>: Can be rhythmic (e.g., dystonic tremors) or arrhythmic (e.g., dystonic movement
            or
            posture).
            <br> - <b>Speed</b>: Varies from very fast (e.g., blepharospasm) to slow (e.g., dystonic postures).
            <br> - <b>Duration of Muscular Contraction</b>: Sustained or intermittent.
            <br> - <b>Duration of Movement</b>: Can be continual (repeating without sudden recurrence, e.g., dystonic
            movements)
            or continuous (without stopping, e.g., dystonic postures).
            <br> - <b>Space Distribution</b>:
            <br> - <b>Body Distribution</b>: Classified as <b>focal</b> (one body part), <b>segmental</b> (≥2 contiguous
            parts),
            <b>multifocal</b> (≥2 non-contiguous parts), <b>hemidystonia</b> (ipsilateral arm and leg), or
            <b>generalised</b> (≥3 body parts including trunk and ≥2 other sites).
            <br> - <b>Muscular Pattern</b>: Dystonic movements are typically <b>patterned</b>, involving the same muscle
            group
            repetitively.
            <br> - <b>Amplitude</b>: Can be small (dystonic tremor) or medium (dystonic movements).
            <br> - <b>Body State's Impact</b>:
            <br> - <b>Action Rule</b>: Often initiated or worsened by voluntary action. <b>Overflow muscle
                activation</b> is
            involuntary contraction in a contiguous or non-adjacent site. <b>Mirror dystonia</b> refers to movements
            triggered in the affected limb by actions of the unaffected contralateral limb.
            <br> - <b>Suppressibility</b>: Some dystonic movements are suppressible, often by <b>gestes antagonistes</b>
            (sensory
            tricks), which are voluntary movements that temporarily alleviate dystonia.
            <br> - <b>Wakefulness</b>: Generally present while awake, but severe dystonia can persist during sleep.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Classification (Two Axes)</h2>
        <p>
            The current classification system uses two main axes:
            <br> - <b>Axis I: Clinical Characteristics</b>:
            <br> - - > <b>Age at Onset</b>: Infancy (birth-2 years), Childhood (3-12 years), Adolescence (13-20 years),
            Early
            adulthood (21-40 years), Late adulthood (>40 years). Dystonia in children is more likely to generalize,
            while in
            adults it often remains focal.
            <br> - - > <b>Body Distribution</b>: As described above (Focal, Segmental, Multifocal, Generalised,
            Hemidystonia).
            <br> - - > <b>Temporal Pattern</b>:
            <br> - - > <b>Disease Course</b>: Static (no progression) or Progressive (progression over time).
            <br> - - > <b>Variability</b>: Persistent (same intensity throughout day), Paroxysmal (self-limited, triggered
            episodes),
            Diurnal fluctuations (vary with circadian rhythm), Action-specific (only during specific tasks).
            <br> - - > <b>Associated Features</b>:
            <br> - - > <b>Isolated Dystonia</b>: Dystonia is the sole motor feature, possibly with tremor.
            <br> - - > <b>Combined Dystonia</b>: Dystonia co-occurs with other movement disorders (e.g., myoclonus,
            parkinsonism).
            <br> - - > <b>Complex Dystonia</b>: Dystonia accompanied by other neurological or systemic manifestations beyond
            movement
            disorders.
            <br>
            <br> - <b>Axis II: Etiology</b>:
            <br> - - > <b>Nervous System Pathology</b>: Evidence of degeneration, evidence of structural (often static)
            lesions, or
            no evidence of degeneration or structural lesions.
            <br> - - > <b>Cause Definition</b>:
            <br> - - > <b>Inherited</b>: Due to proven genetic origin (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked
            recessive,
            X-linked dominant, mitochondrial).
            <br> - - > <b>Acquired</b>: Due to a known non-genetic specific cause (e.g., perinatal brain injury, infection,
            drugs,
            toxins, vascular events, brain injury, neoplastic, autoimmune, functional).
            <br> - - > <b>Idiopathic</b>: Without an identifiable cause, can be sporadic or familial.

            <br> - <b>Psychogenic (Functional) Dystonia</b>: Can mimic organic dystonia, but cues like psychiatric

        </p>

        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>
            Dystonia is increasingly understood as a <b>dysfunctional network disorder</b> involving the
            <b>cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical and cortico-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops</b>. Key mechanisms
            include:
            <br> - <b>Anatomical Correlates</b>: While basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus internus) are implicated,
            structural abnormalities are also noted in the cerebellum, thalamus, and cortex.
            <br> - <b>Loss of Inhibition</b>: Manifests as lack of surround inhibition, co-contraction of antagonistic
            muscles,
            and overflow of activity. Studies show enhanced cortical excitability and shorter cortical silent periods in
            dystonia.
            <br> - <b>Abnormal Sensory Function</b>: Patients often experience pain (e.g., cervical dystonia) and
            exhibit sensory
            phenomena like photosensitivity or neck pain before dystonia. The *geste antagoniste<br> - is a notable
            feature,
            indicating abnormal sensory processing and sensorimotor integration. Reduced perception of tonic vibration
            reflex (TVR) and abnormalities in spatial and temporal discrimination thresholds (GOT, STDT) are observed.
            <br> - <b>Abnormal Synaptic Plasticity</b>: Excessive plasticity responses, like altered long-term
            potentiation (LTP)
            and long-term depression (LTD), and loss of topographical specificity in sensorimotor circuits are
            suggested.
            <br> - <b>Mirror Movements</b>: Considered an expression of motor overflow, linked to impaired
            interhemispheric
            inhibition.
            <br> - <b>Molecular Mechanisms</b>: Diverse pathways are affected:
            <br> - <b>Striatal Dopamine Signalling</b>: Defects in dopamine synthesis (GCH1, SPR, PTS, TH, QDPR, DDC,
            DNAJC12),
            cycling (SLC18A2, SLC6A3), and signalling (GNAL, ADCY5, GNAO1, GNB1, DRD2) in striatal neurons are central.
            Alterations in D1 and D2 receptor signalling, affecting direct and indirect pathways, are implicated.
            <br> - <b>Gene Transcription and Neurodevelopment</b>: Pathogenic variants in THAP1 and KMT2B, YY1, and TAF1
            affect
            gene expression and neurodevelopment, leading to aberrant transcriptional regulation and potentially
            affecting
            myelination and synaptic transmission.
            <br> - <b>Calcium Signalling and Synaptic Transmission</b>: Imbalance in Ca2+ homeostasis, often leading to
            neuronal
            hyperexcitability, is linked to genes like ATP1A3, KCNN2, KCNA1, TSPOAP1, CACNA1A, PNKD, PRRT2, SCN8A, HPCA,
            ANO3, KCTD17, TOR1A, and SGCE.
            <br> - <b>Cellular Stress Response</b>: Dysregulated eIF2α signalling (PRKRA, EIF2AK2, ATF4, TOR1A, THAP1,
            XDP)
            contributes to pathogenesis, potentially linking to viral infections as a risk factor.
            <br> - <b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and Nuclear Envelope (NE) Function</b>: TorsinA (TOR1A gene)
            dysfunction leads
            to protein misfolding, trafficking issues, ER stress, and nuclear pore complex (NPC) deficits.
            <br> - <b>Autophagy and Lysosomal Function</b>: Dysfunction in endolysosomal and autophagic systems (VPS16,
            VPS11,
            VPS41, IRF2BPL, SQSTM1) leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, seen in various
            complex dystonias.
            <br> - <b>Cytoskeleton</b>: Abnormalities in cytoskeletal proteins (SGCE, TUBB4A, ACTB) affect synapse
            assembly,
            function, and myelination, causing aberrant neuronal firing.
        </p>

        <h2>Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            Diagnosis relies mainly on a thorough <b>clinical evaluation</b> and <b>physical examination</b> by movement
            disorder specialists. Genetic testing, especially <b>next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques</b> (gene
            panels, exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing), is crucial for inherited forms, particularly in
            early-onset
            or non-isolated dystonia. Variant-specific testing is also used for known founder mutations.
        </p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Treatment options are largely symptomatic:
            <br> - <b>Chemo-denervation</b>: <b>Botulinum toxin injections</b> are widely used for focal and segmental
            dystonia
            to inhibit muscle contraction and reduce tone.
            <br> - <b>Pharmacological Therapies</b>:
            <br> - <b>Levodopa</b>: Highly effective for dopa-responsive dystonias (DRD).
            <br> - <b>Anticholinergics</b>: An alternative, though high doses can cause significant side effects.
            <br> - Other options include <b>baclofen</b> (oral or intrathecal), <b>tetrabenazine</b>,
            <b>benzodiazepines</b>, and
            <b>neuroleptics</b>, with variable responses and side effects.
            <br> - <b>Surgical Interventions</b>: <b>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</b> of the <b>globus pallidus internus
                (GPi)</b> is a successful alternative for severe, drug-refractory dystonia, and less commonly, the
            subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Response to DBS varies depending on the genetic cause.
            <br> - <b>Physical Therapies</b>: Should always be an integral part of treatment.

        <h1>Rigidity</h1>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Rigidity, in contrast to spasticity, is a resistance to passive stretching that <b>does not depend on the
                velocity of movement</b> and equally affects flexors and extensors, resulting in a uniform resistance
            known
            as the <b>'lead pipe' phenomenon</b>. It can also present as <b>'cogwheel rigidity'</b> if an underlying
            tremor
            is superimposed.
        </p>

        <h2>Aetiology</h2>
        <p>Rigidity is a <b>cardinal sign of Parkinson's disease (PD)</b> and is also seen in atypical parkinsonism.</p>

        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>
            <br> - <b>Exaggeration of Long-Latency Stretch Reflexes (LLSR)</b>: While spinal reflexes are often normal,
            parkinsonian rigidity is linked to exaggerated long-loop or long-latency stretch reflexes (supraspinal
            influence).
            <br> - <b>Enhanced Shortening Reaction (SR) and Stretch-Induced Inhibition (SII)</b>: The combination of
            these
            phenomena contributes to the 'lead pipe' effect.
            <br> - <b>Role of Brainstem</b>: Non-dopaminergic systems in the brainstem, affected by alpha-synuclein
            deposition in
            PD (e.g., sublaterodorsal nucleus, nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, locus coeruleus, caudal raphe,
            pedunculopontine nucleus), contribute to altered motor neuron excitability and rigidity.
            <br> - <b>Non-Neural Factors</b>: Viscoelastic properties of muscle fibres and surrounding connective
            tissues also
            play a role.
            <br> - <b>Network Hypothesis</b>: Abnormal functional connectivity in fronto-parietal networks is associated
            with
            akinetic-rigid subtypes of PD.
            <br> - <b>Activation Manoeuvre (Froment’s Manoeuvre)</b>: Rigidity can increase with muscle contraction in
            the
            contralateral limb, possibly due to enhanced LLSR, altered spinal motoneuron excitability, or facilitation
            of
            bilateral descending reticulospinal projection.
        </p>

        <h1>Paratonia</h1>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Paratonia is an increased muscle tone in response to passive movement that is <b>proportional to the
                strength of
                the stimulus applied</b>. It is non-velocity dependent and can be elicited in any direction,
            differentiating
            it from spasticity and rigidity. It can be facilitatory (patient assists passive movement) or oppositional
            (resistance increases with increasing movements).
        </p>
        <h2>Aetiology</h2>
        <p>Primarily linked to <b>defective response inhibition secondary to frontal lobe dysfunction</b>.</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>
            <br> - <b>Defective Response Inhibition</b>: Orbitofrontal damage and frontal-subcortical dysfunction disrupt
            the
            balance between internal and external motor control circuits, leading to disinhibited behaviour.
            <br> - <b>Non-Neural Factors</b>: Increased tissue stiffness due to <b>Advanced Glycation End Products
                (AGEs)</b>
            deposition in muscle collagen may contribute, especially in dementia patients.
        </p>
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Botulinum toxin is known to relieve the involuntary resistance seen in paratonia.
            In conclusion, muscle tone disorders like spasticity, rigidity, dystonia, and paratonia each have distinct
            clinical presentations, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and aetiologies, requiring careful assessment
            and tailored, often multimodal, treatment approaches.
