    <h1>Introduction to Iron Physiology</h1>
    <p>
        Iron is one of the most essential trace elements in the human body. It plays a <strong>central role</strong> in oxygen transport, electron transfer, and cellular respiration. Without iron, the basic processes that sustain life would collapse. As a cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions and a structural component of proteins like hemoglobin and myoglobin, <strong>iron homeostasis</strong> is tightly regulated to avoid both deficiency and overload.
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand iron physiology at a clinical level, it is essential to revisit some foundational <strong>anatomy</strong>, <strong>cell biology</strong>, and <strong>biochemistry</strong>. Iron is absorbed primarily in the <strong>duodenum</strong> and <strong>proximal jejunum</strong>, bound in circulation to <strong>transferrin</strong>, stored intracellularly as <strong>ferritin</strong> or <strong>hemosiderin</strong>, and regulated systemically by the hepatic hormone <strong>hepcidin</strong>. The human body contains approximately 3-4 grams of iron, with <strong>~65%</strong> found in hemoglobin, <strong>~10%</strong> in myoglobin, <strong>~15-30%</strong> in storage, and trace amounts in various enzymes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically, the significance of iron dates back to the recognition of pallor and fatigue in blood loss, leading to the term "iron-deficiency anemia." Over the centuries, this has evolved into a rich understanding of iron's biochemical and physiological roles. In modern medicine, abnormalities in iron metabolism can point to chronic disease, inflammation, malignancy, or genetic disorders like hemochromatosis.

    <div class="explanation-card">
    <h2>Iron Absorption and Transport</h2>
    <p>
        Iron enters the body through <strong>dietary intake</strong>, which includes both <strong>heme iron</strong> (from animal products) and <strong>non-heme iron</strong> (from plant sources). Heme iron is more bioavailable and is absorbed directly by <strong>heme transporter 1 (HCP1)</strong> in enterocytes. Non-heme iron, on the other hand, must first be reduced from ferric (**Fe³⁺**) to ferrous (**Fe²⁺**) iron by <strong>duodenal cytochrome B (Dcytb)</strong> on the apical surface of enterocytes before being transported via <strong>divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once inside the enterocyte, iron has two possible fates: it can be stored temporarily as <strong>ferritin</strong> or exported into the circulation by <strong>ferroportin</strong>, the only known iron exporter in human cells. At this critical juncture, the systemic hormone <strong>hepcidin</strong> plays a regulatory role by binding ferroportin and inducing its degradation, thus blocking further iron release into plasma.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the bloodstream, free iron is toxic due to its ability to catalyze free radical formation (via the Fenton reaction). Therefore, iron is transported bound to <strong>transferrin</strong>, a glycoprotein that delivers iron to target tissues, especially the <strong>bone marrow</strong>, where erythropoiesis occurs.

    <h2>Storage and Recycling of Iron</h2>
    <p>
        The human body has no regulated mechanism for iron excretion; therefore, iron balance is maintained by regulating <strong>absorption</strong> and <strong>recycling</strong>. The largest reservoir of iron is found within <strong>erythrocytes</strong> as hemoglobin. Senescent red blood cells are phagocytosed by <strong>macrophages</strong> in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow – the <strong>reticuloendothelial system</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within macrophages, hemoglobin is broken down; iron is extracted and either stored as <strong>ferritin</strong> or released back into the plasma via ferroportin. This iron is then recycled into new hemoglobin during erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. This closed-loop system efficiently recycles approximately <strong>20–25 mg of iron per day</strong>, vastly exceeding the 1–2 mg absorbed from the diet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ferritin stores iron in a soluble, non-toxic form and is often used clinically as a surrogate for total body iron. However, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant, so <strong>ferritin levels may be elevated in inflammation</strong>, misleading interpretation. In cases of overload, excess iron is stored as <strong>hemosiderin</strong>, which is less readily mobilized.

    <div class="explanation-card">
    <h2>Iron Regulation and Hepcidin</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>central regulator of systemic iron balance</strong> is the hepatic hormone <strong>hepcidin</strong>, synthesized in the liver in response to iron levels, hypoxia, inflammation, and erythropoietic activity. Hepcidin inhibits iron release by promoting <strong>internalization and degradation of ferroportin</strong>. This blocks both iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages.
    </p>
    <p>
        In iron deficiency or increased erythropoietic demand (e.g., anemia or hypoxia), <strong>hepcidin synthesis decreases</strong>, allowing more iron into the plasma. Conversely, in iron overload or inflammation (via IL-6), <strong>hepcidin increases</strong>, trapping iron in stores and reducing plasma iron.
    </p>

        <p><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> <em>"High Iron? Hepcidin Hits!"</em></p>

    <h2>Clinical Correlates: Iron Deficiency and Overload</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)</strong> is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. It is characterized by <strong>microcytic, hypochromic anemia</strong>, often due to chronic blood loss (e.g., GI bleeding, menstruation), malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease), or increased demand (e.g., pregnancy). Classic symptoms include <strong>fatigue, pallor, pica</strong>, and <strong>restless leg syndrome</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>iron overload disorders</strong>, like <strong>hereditary hemochromatosis</strong>, involve excessive intestinal iron absorption due to mutations in the <strong>HFE gene</strong>, leading to progressive iron deposition in the liver, pancreas, heart, and joints. Clinical signs include <strong>bronze skin</strong>, <strong>diabetes ("bronze diabetes")</strong>, <strong>cirrhosis</strong>, and <strong>cardiomyopathy</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Serum <strong>ferritin</strong>, <strong>transferrin saturation</strong>, and <strong>total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)</strong> are key laboratory markers used to assess iron status. In IDA, ferritin is low, TIBC is high, and transferrin saturation is low. In hemochromatosis, ferritin and transferrin saturation are high, with low TIBC.
