        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Blood accounts for roughly <b>7% of human body weight</b>, totaling to a volume of roughly <b>5 liters</b> in the average adult. Blood then, is composed of two elements:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Plasma</li>
            <li><i>Formed elements</i>: <i>corpuscles</i> (i.e., erythrocytes and leukocytes) and cell fragments (i.e., leukocytes)</li>

        </ol>

        <p>In total then, plasma makes up around <b>54.3% of volume</b>, while red blood cells constitute <b>45%</b> and white blood cells a meagre <b>0.7%</b>.</p>

        <h2>Blood plasma</h2>
        <p>Essentially an aqueous solution, it contains <b>92% water</b> and <b>8% blood plasma proteins</b>. Furthermore, it circulates important nutrients through the body. <b>Serum</b>, then, refers to plasma from which the <b>clotting proteins</b> have been removed. The proteins that then remain are <b>albumin</b> and <b>immunoglobulins</b>.</p>

        <p>The way that blood plasma is won, is by a method called <b>blood fractionation</b> in which an anticoagulant is added to a tube of blood, which is then spun in a centrifuge until the cells fall to the bottom of the tube after which the plasma may be drawn off. This may then be used to produce "fresh frozen plasma", which is used to treat conditions where there are <b>low blood clotting factors</b>.</p>

        <h1>Erythrocytes</h1>

        <p>These cells, shaped like <b>biconcave discs</b> lack a cell nucleus (expelled during development) and organelles. This is so that there is maximum space for the <b>haemoglobin-rich cytoplasm</b> which fulfills the essential function of the cell. Every second <b>2.4 milion new erythrocytes</b> are produced per second in the average adult. They mature in roughly <b>7 days</b> from stem cells in a process called <b>erythropoiesis</b>, with an intermediate stage in which they're called <b>reticulocytes</b>, which takes place in essentially all bones up to 25 y/o, after which only the axial bones continue. After production, they circulate for <b>100-120 days</b> before being recycled by macrophages. Each complete circulation through the body takes <b>60 seconds</b>. Production is stimulated by a low O2, which causes the kidneys to produce erythropoietin, which stimulates the maturation of precursors in the bone marrow.</p>

        <p>The surface of these RBCs presents certain <b>antigens</b> (namely A and B), while the serum carries specific <b>antibodies</b>, namely A and B. In order to prevent blood from agglutinating, we need to separate the letters:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Antigen A with Antibody B</li>
            <li>Antigen B with Antibody A</li>
            <li>Antigen AB with neither antibody</li>
            <li>Antigen null with both</li>

        </ol>

        <p>While these are the most famous, the surface of the RBCs also presents so-called Rhesus antigens. These ion channel-like proteins carry much variation, with some variations appearing more in specific ethnic groups. The most common (and often the only noted) group is called D, but there are also C, E, c and e. Strangely enough, there is no antigen "d" as that denotes the <b>absence</b> of antigen D. The <b>antibodies</b> then, are a form of <b>immunoglobulin G</b>, and are acquired through exposure to Rh-positive blood (either through <b>pregnancy</b> or <b>transfusion</b>). In approxamitely <b>80% of cases</b>, even a single exposure to Rh(D+) blood, will lead to so called <i>alloimmunisation</i>. This percentage is significantly reduced in patients who are actively exsanguinating. So ideally, we should not give Rh(D) blood to an Rh(D) patient.</p>
        <p>Notably, the genetic origin to anti-c and anti-E is the same, so if one is detected, you should automatically detect the other. </p>
