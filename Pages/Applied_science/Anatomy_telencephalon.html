        <h1>Primer on neural development</h1>
        <p>
            The neural tube divides early on into:
            <br>1. Prosencephalon (Forebrain): The most anterior part, destined to become the cerebrum and diencephalon.
            <br>2. Mesencephalon (Midbrain): The middle section.
            <br>3. Rhombencephalon (Hindbrain): The most caudal section, which further develops into the pons,
            cerebellum, and
            medulla.
        </p>

        <div class="mnemonic">PM&R -> <b>P</b>rosencephalon, <b>M</b>esencephalon and <b>R</b>hombencephalon</div>

        <p>
            Later in development, the Prosencephalon divides into the Telencephalon and the Diencephalon. The
            Telencephalon derivatives include the cerebral cortices, as well as the caudate, putamen, Globus pallidus,
            and
            ventral pallidum, which are components of the basal ganglia. The Diencephalon gives rise to the Thalamus,
            Subthalamus, Epithalamus, Hypothalamus, and the subthalamic nucleus; which is what we will talk about here.

        <h1>Subcortical Structures: The Basal Ganglia</h1>
        <h2>Gross anatomy</h2>
        <p>
            Basal Ganglia (BG): This group of subcortical nuclei, often called basal nuclei, resides deep within the
            cerebrum, at the base of the forebrain and top of the midbrain. Imagine them as "BG: Brain's Gatekeepers,"
            controlling access to motor and thought pathways. They consist of distinct masses of gray matter, largely
            mirroring each other on the left and right sides. The primary components are the striatum, pallidum,
            substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. The striatum and pallidum are relatively large, while the
            substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are smaller and located more posteriorly.
            <br> - <b>Striatum</b>: It's like the "STRata of Entry" for information. It's divided into two main parts:
            the dorsal striatum (comprising the caudate nucleus and putamen) and the ventral striatum (made up of the
            nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). The internal capsule separates the caudate and putamen. Mnemonic:
            "Dolphins Play, Vending Nuts Often" (Dorsal: Putamen, Caudate; Ventral: Nucleus Accumbens, Olfactory
            Tubercle) to remember striatal subdivisions. The putamen and globus pallidus together form the lentiform
            nucleus.
            <br> - <b>Pallidum</b>: This includes the globus pallidus (divided into external and internal regions) and
            the ventral pallidum.
            <br> - <b>Substantia Nigra</b>: Distinguished by its dark appearance, it has two parts: pars compacta (SNc)
            and pars reticulata (SNr).
            <br> - <b>Subthalamic Nucleus</b>: A small but vital part of the subthalamus.
        </p>
        <h2>Functional Anatomy:</h2>
        <p>
            Basal Ganglia: The "Brain's Gatekeepers" are associated with diverse functions, including regulating
            voluntary motor movements, procedural learning, habit formation, conditional learning, eye movements,
            cognition, and emotion. They play a central role in reward learning and aspects of frontal lobe functioning
            via the mesolimbic pathway. Dysfunction can lead to serious neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease
            (due to dopamine-producing cell degeneration in the substantia nigra) and Huntington's disease (striatal
            damage).
            <br> - <b>Striatum</b>: The dorsal striatum is mainly involved in sensorimotor activities, while the ventral
            striatum is crucial for reward and limbic functions.
            <br> - <b>Neurotransmitters</b>: The basal ganglia receive numerous excitatory glutamatergic inputs and send
            out predominantly inhibitory GABAergic signals. Dopamine, primarily from the substantia nigra pars compacta
            to the dorsal striatum and from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum via the mesolimbic
            pathway, plays a vital modulatory role. Addictive drugs, like cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine, are
            thought to boost this dopamine signal.
            <br> - <b>Circuitry</b>: The basal ganglia circuitry involves complex pathways, often simplified into five
            loops: one limbic, two associative (prefrontal), one oculomotor, and one motor pathway. These direct and
            indirect pathways utilize excitatory (glutamatergic), inhibitory (GABAergic), and modulatory (dopaminergic)
            neurotransmission.

        <h1>Cortex: The Brain's Outer Mantle</h1>
        <p>The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle, is the brain's outer layer of neural tissue, critical
            for higher cognitive functions like attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and
            consciousness.</p>
        <h2>Cortex Development:</h2>
        <p>
            The development of the cerebral cortex, known as corticogenesis, is a meticulously orchestrated process.
            <br>1. Neural Tube Formation: The cortex originates from the most anterior part of the embryonic neural
            tube, the prosencephalon (forebrain). The neural plate folds to form the neural tube, giving rise to the
            brain's various structures.
            <br>2. Neuron Generation: Cortical neurons are born within the ventricular zone, which contains neural stem
            cells that transition into radial glial cells. These radial glia act as progenitor cells, dividing to
            produce both glial cells and neurons.
            <br>3. Inside-Out Lamination: The cortex forms in an "inside-out" manner. The earliest-born neurons migrate
            to form the deep layers (V and VI) of the mature cortex. Later-born neurons migrate radially past these
            older neurons to settle in the more superficial layers (II, III, and IV). The first neurons populate a
            transient layer called the "preplate," which then divides into the superficial marginal zone (which becomes
            Layer I) and the subplate, with a cortical plate forming between them. Memory aid: "Older Goes Deeper,
            Younger Stays Near Surface" to remember the inside-out development.
            <br>4. Cortical Folding (Gyrification): In most mammals, especially larger ones like humans, the cerebral
            cortex is highly folded into gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves), which significantly increases its surface
            area within the confined cranial volume. This process, called gyrification, is regulated by genes like
            Trnp1, FGF, and SHH signaling. Small-brained mammals often have smooth cortices without these folds.
            <br>5. Postnatal Maturation: At birth, cortical neurons have few dendrites and undeveloped axons. During the
            first year of life, dendrites proliferate dramatically, allowing for hundreds of thousands of synaptic
            connections.
        </p>
        <h2>Cortex Layers:</h2>
        <p>
            The neocortex, which constitutes approximately 90% of the human cortex, is characterized by its six distinct
            horizontal layers (I to VI), from the outermost (near the pia mater) to the innermost (near the white
            matter). Each layer has a unique distribution of neurons and connections.:
            <br> - Layer I (Molecular layer): Contains few neurons, mostly apical dendritic tufts and horizontal axons,
            involved in feedback for associative learning and attention.
            <br> - Layer II (External granular layer): Small pyramidal and numerous stellate neurons.
            <br> - Layer III (External pyramidal layer): Small and medium pyramidal neurons, main source of
            corticocortical efferents. Layers I-III are also main targets of commissural corticocortical afferents.
            <br> - Layer IV (Internal granular layer): Diverse stellate and pyramidal cells; this is the primary target
            of thalamocortical afferents. Layers I-III are "supragranular," while V-VI are "infragranular".
            <br> - Layer V (Internal pyramidal layer): Large pyramidal neurons whose axons project to subcortical
            structures like the basal ganglia. In the primary motor cortex, it houses giant Betz cells forming the
            corticospinal tract for voluntary motor control.
            <br> - Layer VI (Polymorphic or Multiform layer): Contains various pyramidal and multiform neurons, sending
            efferent fibers back to the thalamus, establishing precise reciprocal connections.
            <br><br>The remaining 10% of the cortex is the allocortex, which has three or four layers and includes the
            olfactory cortex and hippocampus. A transitional zone, the paralimbic cortex, exists between neocortex and
            allocortex, where layers 2, 3, and 4 are merged.

        <h1>The Cortical Lobes: Specialized Domains</h1>
        <h2>1. Insular Cortex</h2>
        <h3>Gross Anatomy & Subdivisions:</h3>
        <p>
            The insular cortex (or insula) is a hidden part of the cerebral cortex, folded deep within the lateral
            sulcus (Sylvian fissure), which separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes. Imagine it
            as a "Hidden Island" of cortex. It's often referred to as the "insular lobe". The insula is divided by the
            central sulcus of the insula into an anterior insula and a posterior insula. The anterior insula further
            subdivides into three or four short gyri. The cortical areas overlying the insula are called opercula,
            formed by parts of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes that cover it.
            Functional Anatomy:
            The insula is a highly integrated region involved in consciousness, emotion, interoception (awareness of
            internal bodily states), and the regulation of the body's homeostasis.
            <br> - Taste Perception: The anterior insula is a key component of the primary gustatory cortex, processing taste
            and non-taste sensations like food texture and temperature.
            <br> - Speech: It's part of the brain's speech motor control network. The arcuate fasciculus, connecting
            Wernicke's and Broca's areas, passes beneath the insula, meaning insular damage can disrupt speech.
            <br> - Emotions: The anterior insula is implicated in processing emotions, particularly disgust, compassion, and
            empathy.
            <br> - Motor Control: It contributes to motor aspects of swallowing, vocalization, and saccadic eye movements.
            <br> - Mnemonic for Insula Functions: "I.N.S.U.L.A. - Interoception, Navigation (and nausea), Speech,
            Understanding (emotions), Learning, Awareness."
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Supply:</h3>
        <p>The insular cortex primarily receives its blood supply from the middle cerebral artery.</p>
        <h2>2. Limbic Lobe</h2>
        <h3>Gross Anatomy & Subdivisions:</h3>
        <p>
            The limbic lobe is an arc-shaped cortical region situated on the medial surface of each cerebral hemisphere,
            forming a rim of cortex. It's a key component of the broader limbic system. While its definition can be
            somewhat ambiguous, it typically includes parts of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, specifically
            structures like the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, dentate gyrus, and the hippocampus. The amygdala
            is also closely associated with the limbic system.
            <br> - Hippocampus: A major component of the limbic system, this 5-centimeter long ridge of gray matter is
            located in the medial temporal lobe, specifically an inward fold of three-layered archicortex within the
            parahippocampal gyrus. It has distinct head, body, and tail regions. Internally, it is composed of subfields
            (CA1-CA4, or cornu Ammonis) and the dentate gyrus.
            Functional Anatomy:
            Historically linked to olfaction, the limbic lobe and its associated structures are now primarily recognized
            for their role in emotion and memory.
            <br> - Hippocampus: This is your brain's "Memory Maker" and "Spatial Navigator." It's crucial for the
            consolidation of short-term memories into long-term memories and is vital for spatial memory that enables
            navigation. Damage to both hippocampi (as famously seen in patient H.M.) leads to severe anterograde
            amnesia, making it impossible to form new long-term declarative memories. The posterior hippocampus, in
            particular, is specialized for spatial and verbal memory. It also plays a role in social memory. Mnemonic:
            "You'd be LOST without your Hippo-CAMPUS!" (Lost = Spatial Memory, Campus = Learning/Memory Formation).
            <br> - Amygdala: Anatomically connected to the hippocampus, it's involved in emotional behavior.
            <br> - Limbic Circuit: As part of the basal ganglia system, a limbic circuit exists, involving projections from
            the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and insula to the ventral striatum,
            highlighting its role in reward and motivation.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Supply:</h3>
        <p>As part of the cerebral cortex, the limbic lobe and hippocampus receive blood from the general cerebral
            circulation, predominantly the posterior cerebral artery and branches of the middle cerebral artery, given
            their medial temporal location.</p>
        <h2>3. Occipital Lobe</h2>
        <h3>Gross Anatomy & Subdivisions:</h3>
        <p>
            The occipital lobe is the smallest of the four major lobes, situated at the very back of the skull,
            overlying the occipital bone. It's essentially the "Visual V-Spot" of the brain.
            <br> - Occipital Pole: The most posterior, rounded tip of the lobe.
            <br> - Occipital Gyri: Several ridges on the surface, separated by the lateral occipital sulcus.
            <br> - Calcarine Sulcus: A prominent Y-shaped groove on the medial surface that divides the lobe.
            <br> - Cuneus: The cortical area located above the calcarine sulcus.
            <br> - Lingual Gyrus: The cortical area located below the calcarine sulcus.
            <br> - Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Also known as Brodmann area 17 or striate cortex (due to the visible "stria of
            Gennari" formed by myelin), this is the main visual processing area, located within the calcarine sulcus and
            extending onto the occipital pole.
            <br> - Extrastriate Cortex: All other visually driven regions outside V1.
        </p>
        <h3>Functional Anatomy:</h3>
        <p>
            The occipital lobe is the dedicated visual processing center of the mammalian brain.
            <br> - V1 (Primary Visual Cortex): Processes basic visual information like orientation, spatial frequency, and
            color properties.
            <br> - Visual Streams: V1 projects to two main pathways:
            <br><br> - ->Ventral Stream ("What pathway"): Involving V2 and V4, it's responsible for processing the "what" of
            vision, identifying objects and their features for memory.
            <br> - ->Dorsal Stream ("Where/How pathway"): Involving V3, V5 (MT), and the dorsomedial area (DM), it handles the
            "where" or "how" to interact with visual stimuli, guiding motor actions. Mnemonic: "What for Ventral, Where
            for Dorsal."
            <br><br> - Retinal Inputs: The cuneus receives visual information from the contralateral superior retina
            (representing the inferior visual field), while the lingual gyrus receives information from the
            contralateral inferior retina (representing the superior visual field). Mnemonic: "Cuneus for Ceiling
            (superior retina), Lingual for Low (inferior retina)."
            <br> - Damage to the primary visual areas can result in partial or complete blindness, including conditions like
            cortical blindness (Anton's syndrome).
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Supply:</h3>
        <p>The occipital lobe receives its primary blood supply from the posterior cerebral artery.</p>
        <h2>4. Parietal Lobe</h2>
        <h3>Gross Anatomy & Subdivisions:</h3>
        <p>
            The parietal lobe is positioned above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe, posterior to the
            central sulcus. Think of it as the "Perception & Position" lobe.
            <br> - Boundaries: It's defined by the central sulcus (anterior), parieto-occipital sulcus (posterior), and
            lateral sulcus (inferior). The longitudinal fissure divides the two hemispheres.
            <br> - Postcentral Gyrus: Immediately posterior to the central sulcus, this gyrus contains the primary
            somatosensory cortical area (Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2), which is the main sensory receptive area for
            touch.
            <br> - Posterior Parietal Cortex: This region is further divided into the superior parietal lobule (Brodmann
            areas 5 and 7) and the inferior parietal lobule (Brodmann areas 39 and 40), separated by the intraparietal
            sulcus (IPS).
            <br> - IPS Subdivisions: The IPS itself has functional subdivisions: medial (MIP), lateral (LIP), ventral (VIP),
            and anterior (AIP) areas.
        </p>
        <h3>Functional Anatomy:</h3>
        <p>
            The parietal lobe is a hub for integrating sensory information from various modalities, including touch,
            temperature, pain, and importantly, spatial sense and navigation (proprioception).
            <br> - Somatosensory Cortex: Receives major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, pain) via the
            thalamus. A fascinating representation called the cortical homunculus depicts body parts on this cortex,
            scaled by the density of their sensory innervation (e.g., lips and fingertips have large cortical areas).
            Memory aid: Imagine "the little man who feels everything" stretched across your brain.
            <br> - Spatial Awareness: The superior and inferior parietal lobules are crucial for body and spatial awareness.
            Damage to the right superior or inferior parietal lobule can lead to hemispatial neglect.
            <br> - Language Processing: Several areas, including portions of the inferior parietal lobule, are important for
            language processing. Wernicke's area, vital for language comprehension, spans the junction of the temporal
            and parietal lobes.
            <br> - Movement Guidance: The posterior parietal cortex plays a role in guiding voluntary movements in space. The
            IPS subdivisions are critical for specific aspects of movement and spatial processing:
            <br><br> - ->LIP (Lateral Intraparietal): Involved in spatial saliency, attention, and oculomotor control (eye
            movements).
            <br> - ->VIP (Ventral Intraparietal): Receives multi-sensory input (visual, somatosensory, auditory, vestibular)
            and represents space in a head-centered reference frame.
            <br> - ->MIP (Medial Intraparietal): Encodes reach target locations.
            <br> - ->AIP (Anterior Intraparietal): Important for grasping and manipulating objects, integrating motor and
            visual inputs.
            <br><br> - Memory: Emerging evidence links the inferior parietal lobe to declarative memory, influencing memory
            strength and confidence.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Supply:</h3>
        <p>The parietal lobe receives blood supply primarily from the middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral
            artery.</p>
        <h2>5. Temporal Lobe</h2>
        <h3>Gross Anatomy & Subdivisions:</h3>
        <p>
            The temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres. It's the "Time, Talk,
            and Tunes" lobe, crucial for auditory processing, language, and memory related to time.
            <br> - Medial Temporal Lobe: This region is critical for long-term memory and includes the hippocampal formation,
            perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and entorhinal neocortical regions.
            <br> - Superior Temporal Gyrus: Contains the primary auditory cortex.
            <br> - Fusiform Gyrus: Involved in high-level visual processing, particularly for face recognition.
            <br> - Parahippocampal Gyrus: Involved in processing visual scenes.
        </p>
        <h3>Functional Anatomy:</h3>
        <p>
            The temporal lobe plays a wide range of roles, especially in sensory input processing, memory, and language.
            <br> - Auditory Processing: It's the primary center for auditory perception, holding the primary auditory cortex
            in the superior temporal gyrus. Secondary areas process raw auditory information into meaningful units like
            speech and music.
            <br> - Visual Processing: Interprets the meaning of visual stimuli and is vital for object recognition. The
            ventral temporal cortices are involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli like faces and
            scenes.
            <br> - Language Recognition: In humans, temporal lobe regions are critical for understanding the semantic meaning
            of words. Wernicke's area, located at the temporal-parietal junction (usually in the left hemisphere), is a
            key area for language comprehension. Damage to Wernicke's area results in receptive aphasia (fluent but
            meaningless speech and poor comprehension). Mnemonic: "Wernicke's Waffles = Word Salad" (Damage leads to
            difficulty understanding and producing coherent speech).
            <br> - Memory Formation: The medial temporal lobes, particularly the hippocampi, are essential for encoding
            declarative long-term memories. Damage to this area can cause anterograde amnesia. It also contributes to
            visual memories, modulated by the amygdala.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Supply:</h3>
        <p>The temporal lobe receives its blood supply from both the middle cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral
            artery.</p>
        <h2>6. Frontal Lobe</h2>
        <h3>Gross Anatomy & Subdivisions:</h3>
        <p>
            The frontal lobe is the largest and most anterior of the four major lobes, situated at the front of the
            brain. It's often considered the "Executive Center" of the brain.
            <br> - Boundaries: The central sulcus separates it from the parietal lobe, and the lateral sulcus (Sylvian
            fissure) separates it from the temporal lobe.
            <br> - Frontal Pole: The most anterior, rounded part.
            <br> - Frontal Cortex: The cortical tissue covering the frontal lobe, which includes the premotor, nonprimary
            motor, and primary motor cortices. The anterior part is the prefrontal cortex.
            <br> - Principal Gyri:
            <br><br> - ->Precentral Gyrus: Located directly anterior and parallel to the central sulcus, it houses the primary
            motor cortex.
            <br> - ->Superior, Middle, and Inferior Frontal Gyri: Three horizontally arranged gyri. The inferior frontal gyrus
            is further subdivided into orbital, triangular, and opercular parts.
            <br><br> - Broca's Area: Located in the inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44 and 45), it's crucial for speech
            production.
        </p>
        <h3>Functional Anatomy:</h3>
        <p>
            The frontal lobe is involved in a vast array of higher-level cognitive functions, motor control, and
            personality.
            <br> - Voluntary Motor Control: The primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus controls voluntary movements of
            specific body parts.
            <br> - Executive Functions: The prefrontal cortex (the most anterior part) is central to planning actions,
            abstract thought, decision-making, and working memory. It enables us to filter actions according to social
            norms, consider consequences, and plan for the future. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
            specifically decides which voluntary movements to execute based on higher-order instructions.
            <br> - Language Production: Broca's area is responsible for the motor aspects of language, enabling speech
            production. Damage to this area results in expressive aphasia, where individuals have difficulty producing
            speech but generally understand it. Mnemonic: "Broca's Broken Speech" (Damage leads to difficulty producing
            speech).
            <br> - Dopaminergic Pathways: The frontal lobe contains many dopaminergic neurons, with pathways associated with
            reward, attention, short-term memory, planning, and motivation. Dopamine helps regulate sensory information
            flow from the thalamus to the forebrain.
            <br> - Emotion and Behavior: The frontal lobe plays a significant role in emotion regulation and behavior
            control. Damage can lead to changes in personality and emotional responses.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Supply:</h3>
        <p>The frontal lobe receives its primary blood supply from the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral
