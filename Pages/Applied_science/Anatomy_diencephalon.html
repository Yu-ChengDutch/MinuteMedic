        <h1>Primer on neural development</h1>
        <p>
            The neural tube divides early on into:
            <br>1. Prosencephalon (Forebrain): The most anterior part, destined to become the cerebrum and diencephalon.
            <br>2. Mesencephalon (Midbrain): The middle section.
            <br>3. Rhombencephalon (Hindbrain): The most caudal section, which further develops into the pons,
            cerebellum, and
            medulla.
        </p>

        <div class="mnemonic">PM&R -> <b>P</b>rosencephalon, <b>M</b>esencephalon and <b>R</b>hombencephalon</div>

        <p>
            Later in development, the Prosencephalon divides into the Telencephalon and the Diencephalon. The
            Telencephalon derivatives include the cerebral cortices, as well as the caudate, putamen, Globus pallidus,
            and
            ventral pallidum, which are components of the basal ganglia. The Diencephalon gives rise to the Thalamus,
            Subthalamus, Epithalamus, Hypothalamus, and the subthalamic nucleus; which is what we will talk about here.

        <h1>Diencephalic Structures</h1>
        <p>
            The Diencephalon, also known as the "interbrain" or "tweenbrain," is a critical division of the forebrain,
            situated
            between the telencephalon (cerebrum) and the midbrain. It encloses the third ventricle and consists of four
            main
            structures:
        </p>

        <div class="mnemonic"><b>SHE too</b>: <b>Sub-, Hypo-, Epi-</b>thalamus and the <b>T</b>halamus too</div>

        <h2>A. Thalamus</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Gross Anatomy</b>: The thalamus is a large, paired mass of gray matter, approximately four centimeters
            long and ovoid,
            located superior to the midbrain near the center of the brain. It forms the dorsal part of the diencephalon
            and its
            medial surface constitutes the upper part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle. The two thalami are
            connected
            by a flattened gray band called the interthalamic adhesion. The gray matter of the thalamus is partitioned
            by a
            distinctive Y-shaped internal medullary lamina, which divides its nuclei into anterior, medial, and lateral
            groups.
            The lateral part, phylogenetically newer, is known as the neothalamus. The metathalamus is a subdivision
            made up of
            the lateral geniculate and medial geniculate nuclei.
            <br><br><b>Functional Anatomy</b>: Often called the "relay station" of the brain, the thalamus's primary
            function is to relay
            sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of
            consciousness, sleep,
            and alertness. Almost all thalamic neurons project to the cerebral cortex via thalamocortical radiations,
            facilitating extensive information exchange. The thalamus is functionally connected to the hippocampus,
            forming part
            of the extended hippocampal system at the thalamic anterior nuclei, which is crucial for human episodic
            event memory
            and differentiates recollective and familiarity memory. It is also a subcortical motor center, providing
            specific
            channels from the basal ganglia and cerebellum to cortical motor areas, and is involved in controlling eye
            movements
            like antisaccades.
            <br><br><b>Blood Supply</b>: The thalamus receives its blood supply from branches of the posterior cerebral
            artery. These branches
            include the polar artery, paramedian thalamic-subthalamic arteries, inferolateral (thalamogeniculate)
            arteries, and
            posterior (medial and lateral) choroidal arteries. A rare anatomical variation, the artery of Percheron,
            supplies
            both parts of the thalamus through a single trunk.
        </p>

        <h2>B. Hypothalamus</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Gross Anatomy</b>: The hypothalamus is a small part of the vertebrate brain located below the thalamus,
            forming the
            basal part of the diencephalon. In humans, it is about the size of an almond. It is divided into four
            regions
            (preoptic, supraoptic, tuberal, mammillary) along the anterior-posterior axis and three zones
            (periventricular,
            intermediate, lateral) along the medial-lateral axis. It contains numerous nuclei, each with distinct
            functions.
            <br><br><b>Functional Anatomy</b>: The hypothalamus serves as a vital link between the nervous system and
            the endocrine system via
            the pituitary gland, acting as a central neuroendocrine hub. It is a component of the limbic system, with
            connections to limbic structures like the amygdala and septum. Key functions and associated nuclei include:
            <br> - Hormone Release:
            <br> - -> Posterior Pituitary: Magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and
            supraoptic nucleus
            produce oxytocin and vasopressin.
            <br> - -> Anterior Pituitary: Parvocellular neurosecretory cells of the paraventricular nucleus release
            hormones (e.g.,
            corticotropin-releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin, dopamine, growth
            hormone-releasing
            hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone) into the hypophyseal portal system, regulating anterior pituitary
            secretions.
            <br> - Thermoregulation: Preoptic and anterior hypothalamic nuclei.
            <br> - Sleep and Arousal: Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (sleep) and paraventricular/tuberomammillary nuclei
            (arousal/wakefulness).
            <br> - Circadian Rhythms: Suprachiasmatic nucleus.
            <br> - Appetite and Satiety: Arcuate nucleus (feeding, GHRH, prolactin inhibition) and ventromedial nucleus
            (satiety).
            The extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus controls food intake; stimulation increases it, while
            bilateral
            lesion causes cessation. Medial parts of the nucleus control the lateral part, with bilateral lesion leading
            to
            hyperphagia and obesity.
            <br> - Memory: Mammillary nuclei.
            <br> - Autonomic Functions: Regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, GI stimulation (dorsomedial nucleus),
            pupillary
            dilation, shivering (posterior nucleus), and sympathetic/parasympathetic responses.
            <br><br>The hypothalamus responds strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids, and contains glucose-sensitive
            and
            thermosensitive neurons. It mediates oxytocin and vasopressin secretion in response to physiological stimuli
            like
            suckling and cardiovascular changes. The hypothalamus also receives inputs from brainstem nuclei (solitary
            tract,
            locus coeruleus) and circumventricular organs (SFO, OVLT) that lack an effective blood-brain barrier,
            allowing it to
            sample blood composition and react to hormones like angiotensin and interleukins.
            <br><br><b>Blood Supply</b>: While specific arteries for the hypothalamus's direct supply are not detailed
            in the provided sources,
            its close proximity to the thalamus and pituitary suggests shared vascularization with branches of the
            posterior
            cerebral artery. The presence of circumventricular organs (like the SFO and OVLT) with fenestrated
            capillaries
            highlights specialized areas for blood sampling, critical for its endocrine functions.
        </p>

        <h2>C. Epithalamus</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Gross Anatomy</b>: The epithalamus is the posterior (dorsal) segment of the diencephalon. It includes
            several
            structures:
            <br> - Pineal gland: A gland that secretes melatonin.
            <br> - Habenular nuclei (Habenula): Involved in connecting the limbic system.
            <br> - Stria medullaris thalami: A white matter tract.
            <br> - Anterior and posterior paraventricular nuclei.
            <br> - Posterior commissure.
            <br><br><b>Functional Anatomy</b>: The primary function of the epithalamus is to connect the limbic system
            to other parts of the
            brain. It is also a key component of the dorsal diencephalic conduction system, which relays information
            from the
            limbic forebrain to limbic midbrain structures. The pineal gland within the epithalamus is responsible for
            the
            secretion of melatonin, which is crucial for regulating circadian rhythms like sleep-wake cycles. This
            secretion is
            influenced by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. The epithalamus also contributes to the
            regulation of
            motor pathways and emotions, and the conservation of energy in the body.
            <br><br><b>Blood Supply</b>: The sources do not specifically detail the blood supply to the epithalamus, but
            as part of the
            diencephalon, it would generally share arterial supply originating from the posterior cerebral artery
            system.
        </p>

        <h2>D. Subthalamus</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Gross Anatomy</b>: The subthalamus, also known as the ventral thalamus, is a part of the diencephalon
            located ventral
            (below) to the thalamus, medial to the internal capsule, and lateral to the hypothalamus. Its most prominent
            structure is the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Other associated structures include the zona incerta,
            subthalamic
            fasciculus, and the Fields of Forel (H1 and H2).
            <br><br><b>Functional Anatomy</b>: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is crucial in motor control. Its neurons
            primarily contain
            glutamate, and they exert excitatory effects on neurons of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. The
            subthalamus
            has reciprocal connections, sending efferent (output) fibers to the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen),
            the
            dorsal thalamus, the red nucleus, and the substantia nigra. It receives afferent (input) connections from
            the
            substantia nigra and striatum. This intricate circuitry makes the subthalamus a critical component of the
            basal
            ganglia system, particularly in the indirect pathway of motor control.
            <br><br><b>Blood Supply</b>: The sources do not explicitly detail the blood supply to the subthalamus, but
            paramedian
            thalamic-subthalamic arteries (branches of the posterior cerebral artery) are mentioned as supplying both
            the
            thalamus and subthalamus.
