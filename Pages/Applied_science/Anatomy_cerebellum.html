    <div class="explanation-card">The cerebellum, often referred to as the "little brain," is a crucial component of the
        central nervous system, predominantly involved in motor control, coordination, and balance. It plays a vital
        role in the precision, timing, and learning of movements, though it does not initiate muscle contractions
        itself.</div>
    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Structural Anatomy</h1>
        <p>The anatomy of the cerebellum can be understood at gross and microscopic levels, each revealing intricate
            details of its organization.</p>
        <h2>Gross Anatomy</h2>
        <p>
            <br><b>Location and Overall Structure</b>: The human cerebellum is situated at the base of the brain,
            nestled within the posterior cranial fossa, inferior to the occipital and temporal lobes of the cerebrum. It
            lies posterior to the pons and the fourth ventricle. A tough layer of dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli,
            separates it from the overlying cerebrum.
            <br><b>Composition</b>: At its core, the cerebellum comprises a tightly folded and crumpled layer of cortex
            (grey matter) on its surface, with white matter underneath. Embedded within this white matter are several
            deep nuclei, and in the middle, a fluid-filled ventricle.
            <br><b>Size and Neurons</b>: Despite making up only 10% of the total brain volume, the cerebellum
            astonishingly contains more neurons than the rest of the brain combined, largely due to its vast number of
            tiny granule cells. The cerebellar cortex, if unfolded, would span about 1 meter long and 10 centimeters
            wide, totaling 500-1000 square cm of neural tissue, packed into a small volume.
            <br><b>Divisions</b>:
            <br> - Hemispheres & Vermis: Like the cerebrum, the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres, connected by
            a narrow midline zone known as the vermis.
            <br> - Anatomical Lobes: Gross inspection reveals three main lobes: the anterior lobe (rostral to the
            primary fissure), the posterior lobe (dorsal to the primary fissure), and the flocculonodular lobe
            (separated by the posterolateral fissure).
            <br> - White Matter: The white matter beneath the cortex is distinctly branched and tree-like, earning it
            the name arbor vitae (Latin for "tree of life").
            <br> - Deep Nuclei: Embedded within the arbor vitae are four pairs of deep cerebellar nuclei, which serve as
            the primary communication centers. From medial to lateral, these are the fastigial, interposed (consisting
            of the globose and emboliform nuclei), and dentate nuclei (the largest). These nuclei receive both
            inhibitory and excitatory signals, influencing their outgoing communications.
        </p>
        <h2>Microanatomy (Cortical Layers & Cell Types) </h2>
        <p>
            The cerebellar cortex is characterized by a highly uniform cellular organization, making its neural
            circuitry relatively straightforward to study. It consists of three distinct layers, from outer to inner:
            the molecular, Purkinje, and granular layers. The cortex's main role is to modulate information flowing
            through the deep nuclei.
            <br><b>Molecular Layer</b>: This is the outermost layer, rich in the dendritic arbors of Purkinje neurons
            and parallel fiber tracts from granule cells. It houses two types of inhibitory interneurons:
            <br> - Stellate cells:
            <br> - Basket cells: Both form GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.
            <br><b>Purkinje Layer</b>: The middle layer contains only the cell bodies of the large Purkinje cells. These
            are the primary integrative neurons of the cerebellar cortex and provide its sole output.
            <br> - Key Characteristics: Purkinje cells have extensive, flat dendritic arbors that extend into the
            molecular layer. They are GABAergic, meaning they form inhibitory synapses with neurons in the deep
            cerebellar and vestibular nuclei.
            <br> - Inputs: Each Purkinje cell receives:
            <br> - ->Excitatory input from 100,000 to 200,000 parallel fibers (from granule cells), which cause "simple
            spikes".
            <br> - ->Input from exactly one climbing fiber (originating from the contralateral inferior olive). A
            helpful mnemonic for climbing fibers is "climb the other olive tree". This single, strong input produces a
            characteristic "complex spike" in the Purkinje cell.
            <br><b>Granular Layer</b>: The innermost layer is densely packed with cell bodies of three types:
            <br> - Granule cells: These are the most numerous neurons in the entire brain (~60-80 billion in humans),
            making up about 70% of all neurons in the brain and spinal cord. They are tiny and send T-shaped axons,
            called parallel fibers, up into the molecular layer.
            <br> - Unipolar brush cells: Slightly larger than granule cells.
            <br> - Golgi cells: Much larger, these cells provide inhibitory feedback to granule cells.
            <br> - Mossy fibers (from the pontine nuclei) enter this layer, forming excitatory synapses with granule
            cells and the deep cerebellar nuclei.
            <br> - ->The flow of neural signals through the cerebellum is almost entirely unidirectional, with inputs
            coming from mossy and climbing fibers that feed into both the deep nuclei and the cerebellar cortex.
            Purkinje neurons, via their powerful inhibitory synapses, regulate the activity of the deep nuclei, which in
            turn affect motor function. The synaptic strength in the cerebellar cortex is highly plastic, allowing for
            continuous adjustment and fine-tuning, which is fundamental for motor learning and coordination.

        <h1>Functional Anatomy</h1>
        <p>
            The cerebellum is a vital center for regulating motor movement, maintaining balance, and coordinating
            precision and timing of movements, as well as facilitating motor learning. While it controls voluntary
            muscle activity and muscle tone, it cannot initiate muscle contraction.
            <br><br>The cerebellum is functionally divided into three parts, which also correspond to its phylogenetic
            (evolutionary) development:
            <br> - -><b>Vestibulocerebellum</b> (also known as Archicerebellum)
            <br>Anatomical Parts: Corresponds to the flocculonodular lobe and immediately adjacent vermis.
            <br>Role: Primarily regulates balance and eye movements. It receives vestibular input (from semicircular
            canals and vestibular nuclei) and visual input, sending fibers back to the vestibular nuclei. Lesions in
            this area lead to disturbances in balance and gait.
            <br><br> - -><b>Spinocerebellum</b> (also known as Paleocerebellum)
            <br>Anatomical Parts: Comprises the vermis and the intermediate (or "paravermis") parts of the hemispheres.
            <br>Role: Regulates body and limb movements. It receives proprioceptive input (from the dorsal columns of
            the spinal cord and trigeminal nerve), as well as visual and auditory information. It projects to deep
            cerebellar nuclei, which then influence the cerebral cortex and brainstem to modulate descending motor
            systems. The spinocerebellum contains sensory maps, with the vermis receiving input from the trunk and
            proximal limbs, and the intermediate parts from the distal limbs. It anticipates future body positions
            during movement in a "feed forward" manner and is involved in error correction.
            <br><br> - -><b>Cerebrocerebellum</b> (also known as Neocerebellum or Pontocerebellum)
            <br>Anatomical Parts: Formed by the lateral parts of the hemispheres.
            <br>Role: Involved in planning movement and evaluating sensory information for action. It receives input
            exclusively from the cerebral cortex (via pontine nuclei and dentate nucleus) and sends fibers primarily to
            the ventrolateral thalamus (connected to motor areas of the premotor and primary motor cortex) and the red
            nucleus. This division also has purely cognitive functions.
            <br><br><b>Clinical Significance - DANISH Mnemonic for Cerebellar Dysfunction</b>
            <br>Damage to the cerebellum can result in various symptoms, often affecting motor control. A helpful
            mnemonic to remember these manifestations is DANISH:
            <br> - ->Dysdiadochokinesia: Difficulty performing rapid, alternating movements.
            <br> - ->Ataxia: Disturbances of voluntary movements, leading to uncoordinated movements and an unsteady,
            broad-based gait.
            <br> - ->Nystagmus: Rhythmical oscillation of the eyes, often coarse.
            <br> - ->Intention tremor: Tremors that worsen during voluntary movements, especially towards the end of a
            movement.
            <br> - ->Scanning speech: Slurred speech where syllables are separated.
            <br> - ->Hypotonia: Reduced muscle tone, where muscles lose resistance to palpation.
            <br><br>Damage to specific functional areas can lead to distinct syndromes:
            <br> - ->Vermis syndrome affects head and trunk coordination, causing posture problems.
            <br> - ->Cerebellar syndrome (involving hemispheres) results in unilateral limb incoordination, dysarthria,
            and nystagmus.

        <p>
            The cerebellum receives its vascular supply from three main paired arteries, all originating from the
            vertebrobasilar system. A memory aid for these arteries is S.A.P.I. (Superior, Anterior, Posterior Inferior)
            or S.C.A.P.I. (Superior Cerebellar, Anterior Inferior Cerebellar, Posterior Inferior Cerebellar).
            <br> - -> <b>Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA)</b>:
            <br>Origin: Branches from the lateral portion of the basilar artery, inferior to its bifurcation into the
            posterior cerebral artery.
            <br>Supply: Supplies most of the cerebellar cortex, the cerebellar nuclei, and the superior cerebellar
            peduncles. It also supplies the pons and splits into medial and lateral branches.
            <br><br> - -> <b>Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA)</b>:
            <br>Origin: Branches off the lateral portion of the basilar artery, superior to the junction of the
            vertebral arteries.
            <br>Supply: Supplies the anterior inferior cerebellum, the middle cerebellar peduncle, the flocculus,
            choroid plexus, and provides blood to the facial (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear nerves (CN VIII).
            <br>Clinical Relevance: Obstruction can lead to facial paresis/paralysis/sensation loss, hearing impairment,
            hyperacusia, vertigo, and infarct of the cerebellopontine angle.
            <br><br> - -> <b>Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)</b>:
            <br>Origin: Branches off the lateral portion of the vertebral arteries, inferior to their junction with the
            basilar artery.
            <br>Supply: The largest vertebral artery branch, it supplies the posterior inferior portion of the
            cerebellum, the inferior cerebellar peduncle, the inferior surface of the vermis, the undersurface of the
            cerebellar hemisphere, the cerebellar nuclei, the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, and several
            cranial nerve nuclei in the medulla oblongata (e.g., nucleus ambiguus, vagus motor nucleus, spinal
            trigeminal nucleus, solitary nucleus, vestibulocochlear nuclei).
            <br>Clinical Relevance: Occlusion of the PICA can cause Wallenberg syndrome, characterized by dysphagia,
            dysarthria, ipsilateral facial analgesia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, ipsilateral Horner syndrome,
            ipsilateral limb ataxia, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.
            <br><br>Venous Drainage: The cerebellum is drained by the superior and inferior cerebellar veins, which
            empty into the superior petrosal, transverse, and straight dural venous sinuses.

        <h1>Connection to the Cerebrum, Brainstem, and Spinal Cord</h1>
        <p>
            The cerebellum connects with other parts of the brain and spinal cord through three pairs of nerve fiber
            bundles called cerebellar peduncles. These peduncles serve as major input and output pathways, often
            following a "groups-of-three" anatomical pattern.
            <br><br> - ->Superior Cerebellar Peduncle (Brachium Conjunctivum)
            <br>Primary Role: Primarily an efferent (output) pathway of the cerebellum.
            <br>Fibers: Most efferent fibers originate within the deep cerebellar nuclei, especially the dentate
            nucleus. They project to various midbrain structures, including the red nucleus, the ventral lateral/ventral
            anterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the medulla.
            <br>Key Pathways: Important for motor planning are the dentatorubrothalamocortical and
            cerebellothalamocortical pathways, which pass through this peduncle.
            <br>Input: Carries some afferent fibers from the anterior spinocerebellar tract to the anterior cerebellar
            lobe.
            <br><br> - ->Middle Cerebellar Peduncle (Brachium Pontis)
            <br>Primary Role: Composed entirely of afferent (input) fibers. It is the largest of the three cerebellar
            peduncles.
            <br>Fibers: Originates within the pontine nuclei, forming a significant part of the corticopontocerebellar
            tract.
            <br>Function: These fibers descend from the sensory and motor areas of the cerebral neocortex, transmitting
            signals that inform the cerebellum about movements in progress and upcoming movements, thereby facilitating
            the continuous adjustment of motor activity.
            <br><br> - ->Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle (Restiform and Juxtarestiform bodies)
            <br>Primary Role: Carries a diverse array of both input and output fibers.
            <br>Function: Mainly concerned with integrating proprioceptive sensory input with motor vestibular
            functions, crucial for balance and posture maintenance.
            <br>Input: Receives proprioceptive information from the body via the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (synapsing
            in the paleocerebellum). Vestibular information projects onto the archicerebellum. It also conveys climbing
            fibers from the inferior olive.
            <br>Output: Carries information directly from Purkinje cells to the vestibular nuclei in the dorsal
            brainstem, located at the junction of the pons and medulla.

            <img src="Images/images_cerebellar_peduncles.jpg">

            <br><br><b>PAthways to the Cerebrum</b>:
            <br> - ->The corticopontocerebellar pathway is the largest associated with the cerebellum. Fibers from the
            cerebral cortex terminate ipsilaterally in the pontine nuclei, then decussate to form the middle cerebellar
            peduncle, ending as mossy fibers in the cerebellar cortex. This pathway relays information about ongoing and
            planned movements.
            <br> - ->The corticoreticulocerebellar pathway relays movement initiation from the cerebral cortex to the
            cerebellum via the reticular formation and inferior/middle peduncles.
            <br> - ->The motor and somatosensory cortices project to the ipsilateral inferior and accessory olivary
            nuclei, forming the olivocerebellar tract which projects to contralateral cerebellar cortex.
            <br> - ->The cerebellum sends projections back to the cerebral cortex via the cerebellothalamic tract,
            through the ventrolateral thalamus, completing a regulatory loop.
            <br> - ->The neocortex and cerebellum exhibit coherent oscillations (6–40 Hz) in awake animals, indicating a
            strong functional relationship where neocortical output influences cerebellar circuits, which then feed back
            to the cerebral cortex. Lesions in association areas linked by corticopontocerebellar fibers can lead to
            cognitive affective syndrome, causing defects in reasoning, attention, speech, spatial sense, and memory.
            <br><br><b>Projections to the Brainstem</b>:
            <br> - ->The cerebellum is physically positioned posterior to the pons and medulla oblongata, and all its
            connections with other brain parts travel through the pons.
            <br> - ->Deep cerebellar nuclei project to various brainstem structures, including the reticular formation
            and vestibular nuclei.
            <br> - ->Purkinje cells directly inhibit the vestibular nuclei in the dorsal brainstem.
            <br> - ->Arteries supplying the cerebellum also provide blood to parts of the brainstem, for instance, the
            SCA supplies the pons, and the PICA supplies several cranial nerve nuclei in the medulla.
            <br><br><b>Connections to the Spinal Cord</b>:
            <br> - ->The spinocerebellum receives crucial proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal
            cord (via the spinocerebellar tract) and the trigeminal nerve.
            <br> - ->The dorsal spinocerebellar tract passes through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to synapse within
            the paleocerebellum.
            <br> - ->Mossy fibers, a primary input source to the cerebellum, can originate from the spinocerebellar
            tract in the ipsilateral spinal cord.
            <br> - ->The anterior spinocerebellar tract conveys afferent fibers to the anterior cerebellar lobe via the
            superior cerebellar peduncle.
