        <h1>What is ethics?</h1>
        <h2>On Meta-ethics</h2>
        <p>Meta-ethics determines which statements are moral, i.e., have to do with ethics, and <b>amoral</b>, i.e., do not have to do with ethics. Now, confusingly, <b>moral</b> also has a different meaning: namely, in contrast to <b>immoral</b>, i.e., that which is unjust. The branch of philosophy which concerns itself with this just-unjust distinction is <b>normative ethics</b>.</p>
        <p>Normative ethics then, concerns itself with norms and values. <b>Norms</b> in this sense, are negatively formulated, concrete principles. <b>Values</b> on the other hand, are positively formulated and unatainable.</p>

        <h1>On normative ethics</h1>
        <p>There are two main theories on what moral behaviour ought to be: teleological and deontological. Here, <b>teleology</b> determines moral behaviour based on it's consequences. Compare the root teleo- and tele-, as in television, to remember that teleo- just means some consequence that is far off. This ultimate goal may be pluralistic, as Plato did, or some monistic objective like pleasure (Epicurius), happiness (Locke) or utility (Bentham). <b>Deontological thought</b>, on the other hand, supposes that an act is moral if and only if it's done according to and because of a certain moral obligation ('pflicht'). The intention to act accordingly is the most important thing.</p>
