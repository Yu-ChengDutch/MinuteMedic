        <h1>Experimental design</h1>
        <p>These studies are also referred to as interventional studies, as opposed to observational studies.</p>

        <p>In <b>Evidence Based Medicine (EMB)</b> the most important way to garner new information is not experience, but clinical studies. These are divided into two types of studies:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Treatment studies</li>
            <li>Observational studies</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Treatment studies</h2>
        <h3>Randomised controlled trial (RCT)</h3>
        <p>This design uses blinding and randomisation to control factors not under direct experimental control. To control for bias, blinding is used. There exist three types of blinding:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Single blinding: Participants are blinded</li>
            <li>Double blinding: Both the participants and the researchers are blinded</li>
            <li>Triple blinding: Participants, researchers and analysts are blinded</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Adaptive design</h3>
        <p>In this design, the methodology of the study may be changed based on an interim study.</p>

        <h3>Nonrandomised trial</h3>
        <p>In a nonrandomised trial or a <b>quasi-experiment</b>, the experiment of an intervention on a population is studied without any randomisation. </p>


        <h2>Observational studies</h2>
        <h3>Descriptive studies</h3>
        <p>These studies describe the situation in a certain population <i>at a certain time</i>, but they don't look at a certain outcome or predictive factor. Based on size, they may be divided in:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Case report</li>
            <li>Case series</li>
            <li>Population study</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Longitudinal studies</h3>
        <p>These studies take specific population <i> and follow them through time</i> instead of just describing them at a moment in time:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Cohort study</li>
            <li>Case-control study</li>
            <li>Cross-sectional study</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cohort study</h4>
        <p>This form of analytical study is a longitudinal study follows a specific cohort which shares a defining characteristics and performs a cross-section at intervals. The repetition in time, however, may take place at different moments:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Prospective cohort study: take a group sharing a characteristic, follow over time and look at outcome</li>
            <li>Retrospective cohort study: take a group sharing an outcome, look at a shared history and determine an effect</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Case-control study</h4>
        <p>In this kind of study, two groups with a different outcome are taken and they are compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. They are used to produce an <b>odds ratio</b>.</p>

        <h4>Cross-sectional study</h4>
        <p>In this kind of study, the cross section of a population is studied in the same manner as in a case-control study.</p>

        <h1>Other studies</h1>
        <h2>Meta-analysis</h2>
        <p>These studies combine the results of multiple studies all addressing a similar research question. The data are pooled, and recalculated to determine a combined effect size.</p>

        <h2>Systematic review</h2>
        <p>These studies review all studies on a certain topics by taking them at face value (i.e., not collecting the data and recalculating but rather just reading the text).</p>

    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <p>In which study is a pooling and recalculation of results perfomred:</p>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 3</h1>
        <p>Prospective and Retrospective studies are an example of which longitudinal study:</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">
            <li data-answer="correct">Cohort study</li>
            <li data-answer="wrong">Case-control study</li>

        </ul>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Bias and confounding</h1>
        <h2>Confounding</h2>
        <p>In terms of variables, we separate two kind of variables:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Independant variables: The predictor that is supposed to influence the outcome</li>
            <li>Dependant variables: The target or outcome variable that we're trying to study</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Then, what are confounders? Here too, we see two kinds of variables that influence the outcome (i.e., dependant) variable that are not the independant variables. These are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Mediators: these are intermediate variables <i>between</i> the exposure and outcome. In other words, the independant variable only influences the dependant variable through the mediator variable</li>
            <li>Confounders: these variables influences both the dependant and independant variables without being influenced itself by either</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The danger of confounders is that they may cause a <b>spurious relation</b> between the dependant and independant variables. This is a relation where there is another explanation for the observed relation, that is not a direct causal effect of the independant variable on the dependant variable.</p>
        <p>As one might imagine, such a spurious relation makes finding the causes relation between the independant and dependant variables challenging. This is a threat to <b>internal validity</b>: namely, making it challenging to find out a causal relationship. <b>External validity</b> on the other hand, tells us about the generalisability of the found effect.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 4</h1>
        <p>Which variable(s) is/are influenced by a confounder:</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">
            <li data-answer="correct">Both the dependant and independant variables</li>
            <li data-answer="wrong">Only the dependant variable</li>
            <li data-answer="wrong">Only the independant variable</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 5</h1>
        <p>A spurious relation, or a "false" relation between independant and dependant, is a threat to what validity:</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">
            <li data-answer="correct">Internal validity</li>
            <li data-answer="wrong">External validity</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Outcomes and effect sizes</h1>
        <h2>Odds ratio</h2>
        <p>This statistic shows the likelyhood of A occuring in the presence of B and vice versa. An <b>Odds Ratio (OR)</b> of 1 means that there is no relation, while an OR higher than 1 means a positive correlation.</p>

        <h2>Relative risk</h2>
        <p>The <b>Relative Risk (RR)</b> or risk ratio is the <b>probability</b> of an outcome in an exposed group vs an unexposed group.</p>

        <h2>Risk difference</h2>
        <p>The <b>Risk Difference (RD)</b>, also known as excess risk or attributable risk is the difference of risk of an outcome in the exposed group vs the unexposed group. In practice, this is calculated as the incidence in exposed minus incidence in unexposed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Errors</h1>
        <h2>Observational error</h2>
        <p>These errors entail a difference between a measured quanitity and an unknown true value. These exist in two kinds:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Random errors</li>
            <li>Systematic errors</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Random errors</h3>
        <p>These errors are indeed random, and are basically what you imagine with broken equipment: the relation between the measurement and the actual value approaches zero. They are described in terms of <b>accuracy</b>, namely how close a give set of observations are to their true value.</p>

        <h3>Systematic</h3>
        <p>These errors introduce a relation that isn't there. Imagine, for example, if a ruler is too short: it will never measure the true value. They are described in terms of <b>precision</b>, which means how close the observations are to each other.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h1>Question 6</h1>
        <p>Accuracy measures what error:</p>

        <ul class="options" id="options">
            <li data-answer="correct">Random error</li>
            <li data-answer="wrong">Systematic error</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Sensitivity and specificity</h1>
        <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
        <p><b>Sensitivity</b> or <b>true positive rate</b> helps ruling out a disease if a test is negative. It is the true positives <i>divided</i> by all the true positives and false negatives.</p>

        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p><b>Specificity</b> or <b>true negative rate</b> is the proportion of people who test negative among all those who actually do not have that disease. It helps rule a disease in when positive. It is calculated as the true negatives <i>divided</i> by true negatives + false positives.</p>

        <h1>Positive and negative predictive values</h1>
        <h2>Positive predictive value</h2>
        <p>The <b>Positive Predictive Value (PPV)</b> is simply the probability of a positive test result given one truly has that disease. It is calculated by the true positive <i>divided</i> by all positives.</p>

        <h2>Negative predictive value</h2>
        <p>The <b>Negative Predictive Value (NPV)</b> is the probability of a negative test result in case one does not have a certain disease. It is calculated by the true negative values <i>divided</i> by all negative values.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
