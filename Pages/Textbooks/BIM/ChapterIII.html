  <h1>Introduction to Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</h1>
  <p>
    In the emergency setting, <b>timely diagnosis and management</b> of traumatic brain injury (TBI) rely heavily on both <b>clinical assessment</b> and <b>neuroimaging</b>. Recent advances in computer technology have allowed for storage and manipulation of <b>high-resolution digital images</b>, significantly improving the precision and speed of neuroimaging interpretation.
  </p>
  <p>
    While many imaging modalities exist, <b>Computed Tomography (CT)</b> and <b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</b> have become the backbone of acute and chronic TBI assessment, offering different strengths in tissue characterization, availability, and speed.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question-card">
  <h1>Question 1</h1>
  <p>Which imaging modality is most commonly used in the acute evaluation of TBI?</p>
  <ul class="options" id="options">
    <li data-answer="correct">Computed Tomography (CT)</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">Plain film radiography</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>Imaging Modalities in TBI</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Plain radiography</b> is largely obsolete in evaluating TBI, offering limited detail except for skull fractures or foreign bodies. In contrast, <b>CT scans</b> are used as the initial diagnostic tool due to their <b>speed</b>, <b>accessibility</b>, and <b>sensitivity to hemorrhage</b>. Modern <b>helical CT scanners</b> can rapidly image the entire body, a vital feature in polytrauma scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>MRI</b>, although slower and less available in acute trauma, is invaluable in identifying <b>subtle brain injuries</b>, such as <b>diffuse axonal injury (DAI)</b> or <b>non-hemorrhagic contusions</b>, often invisible on CT. Its strength lies in <b>soft tissue contrast</b>, <b>multiplanar imaging</b>, and <b>sensitivity to fluid shifts and chronic blood products</b>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question-card">
  <h1>Question 2</h1>
  <p>Why is CT favored over MRI in acute TBI?</p>
  <ul class="options" id="options">
    <li data-answer="correct">It is faster and more widely available</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">It offers better soft tissue detail</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">It is less sensitive to radiation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>CT Principles and Techniques</h2>
  <p>
    The invention of CT was revolutionary, earning Hounsfield and Cormack the <b>Nobel Prize in 1979</b>. Modern CT uses <b>X-ray attenuation differences</b>, expressed in <b>Hounsfield Units (HU)</b>, to differentiate tissues. <b>Air</b> measures around -1000 HU, <b>water</b> is 0 HU, and <b>bone</b> and <b>metal</b> appear very bright due to high HU values.
  </p>
  <p>
    The diagnostic power of CT lies in its <b>contrast resolution</b>, enhanced by adjusting <b>window settings</b> tailored for bone, soft tissue, or brain structures. In <b>non-contrast CT</b>—the standard for acute TBI—</b>acute blood</b> is hyperdense and thus easily identifiable. Intravenous contrast is only used when vascular pathology is suspected, as it may obscure acute hemorrhage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>only absolute contraindication</b> to a non-contrast CT is an <b>unstable patient</b>, though <b>pregnant women and children</b> require special consideration due to <b>radiation exposure</b>.
  </p>

  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>MRI Principles and Use in TBI</h2>
  <p>
    <b>MRI</b> leverages the behavior of <b>hydrogen protons</b> in tissues when exposed to strong magnetic fields. Upon disruption by a <b>radiofrequency pulse</b>, protons enter a high-energy state. Their <b>relaxation</b> to equilibrium is quantified by <b>T1</b> and <b>T2</b> relaxation times. These properties enable detailed imaging of <b>brain anatomy and fluid dynamics</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Water</b> appears <b>dark on T1</b> and <b>bright on T2</b>, while <b>fat</b> is generally bright on both. <b>Gradient fields</b> help localize the proton signals, producing high-resolution multiplanar images. <b>Gadolinium</b>, a <b>non-iodinated contrast agent</b>, is used to assess vascularity or <b>blood-brain barrier breakdown</b>, especially in <b>subacute or chronic phases</b>.

  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>Imaging Pathology in Acute TBI</h2>
  <p>
    The <b>adult skull</b> is a <b>fixed compartment</b>, so even small lesions can cause dangerous <b>mass effect</b>. Initial imaging starts with <b>non-contrast CT</b> focusing on midline shift, ventricles, cisterns, herniation, and extra- or intra-axial lesions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Pneumocephalus</b> indicates a communication with air, usually due to <b>fracture</b>. Brain structures are classified as <b>intra-axial</b> (within the brain) or <b>extra-axial</b> (e.g., meninges and CSF spaces). Understanding this distinction helps localize pathology.

  <h3>Intra-Axial Injuries: Contusions, DAI, Herniation, Edema</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Brain contusions</b> occur when blunt or penetrating trauma damages brain tissue. These may be <b>hemorrhagic</b>, appearing bright on CT, or <b>non-hemorrhagic</b>, appearing dark due to edema. The <b>frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes</b> are often involved, due to their proximity to bony ridges.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI)</b> results from <b>rotational or acceleration/deceleration forces</b>. Damage often occurs at the <b>gray-white junction</b>, <b>corpus callosum</b>, and <b>brainstem</b>. CT may miss these subtle injuries, while MRI—especially with <b>FLAIR</b> or <b>GRE sequences</b>—can reveal hemorrhagic foci.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <b>normal CT scan</b> in a comatose patient strongly suggests DAI, which is associated with <b>poor prognosis</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Herniation syndromes</b> reflect dangerous shifts in brain compartments due to increased pressure. Types include <b>subfalcine</b>, <b>uncal</b>, <b>tonsillar</b>, <b>transsphenoidal</b>, and <b>external herniation</b>. The most common is subfalcine, causing displacement under the falx cerebri.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Cerebral edema</b> leads to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). <b>Cytotoxic edema</b> (irreversible) results from cellular injury and is seen as restricted diffusion on DWI MRI. <b>Vasogenic edema</b> (reversible) arises from increased extracellular fluid, often around tumors, and appears as fingerlike low-density areas on imaging.
  </p>

  <h1>Question 7</h1>
  <p>Which type of herniation involves downward displacement of the temporal lobe?</p>
  <ul class="options" id="options">
    <li data-answer="correct">Uncal</li>

    <li data-answer="wrong">Subfalcine</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h3>Extra-Axial Hemorrhages and Hydrocephalus</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Subdural Hematomas (SDH)</b> result from tearing of bridging veins. On CT, acute SDH appears <b>hyperdense and crescent-shaped</b>. Over time, it becomes <b>isodense</b> and later <b>hypodense</b>. Early diagnosis is vital: mortality is reduced if treated within 4 hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Subdural Hygromas</b> are CSF collections in the subdural space due to arachnoid tears, and resemble chronic SDH on CT. MRI can differentiate based on CSF signal characteristics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Epidural Hematomas (EDH)</b> are <b>biconvex (lens-shaped)</b> and occur between the dura and skull, often from <b>middle meningeal artery</b> rupture. Unlike SDH, EDHs don’t cross sutures but may cross midline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)</b> appears as <b>hyperdensity in sulci/cisterns</b>. Most SAHs are aneurysmal, but trauma can also cause it. MRI (FLAIR) detects chronic SAH.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH)</b> may arise from SAH extension or primary subependymal rupture. It risks <b>hydrocephalus</b>. 
    <b>Hydrocephalus</b> itself can be communicating (due to poor CSF resorption) or non-communicating (obstruction). 
    <b>Hydrocephalus ex vacuo</b>, in contrast, reflects atrophy without raised pressure.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question-card">
  <h1>Question 8</h1>
  <p>What distinguishes an epidural hematoma from a subdural hematoma?</p>
  <ul class="options" id="options">
    <li data-answer="correct">EDH is lens-shaped and does not cross sutures</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">EDH is crescent-shaped and crosses sutures</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">EDH occurs in the subarachnoid space</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h3>Prognostic Imaging in TBI</h3>
  <p>
    <b>CT</b> provides crucial triage data: signs such as <b>midline shift</b>, <b>ventricle compression</b>, and <b>cistern effacement</b> predict <b>increased ICP</b>. The <b>National Traumatic Coma Data Bank</b> found that cistern effacement and shift are powerful mortality predictors.
  </p>
  <p>
    A normal CT in a comatose patient suggests <b>DAI</b>, emphasizing that imaging and clinical exam must be interpreted together. The <b>location of injury</b> also matters: <b>brainstem lesions</b> imply worse functional outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>MRI</b> helps assess long-term sequelae and guides rehabilitation, while <b>delayed complications</b>, such as <b>delayed hemorrhage</b>, warrant follow-up imaging. 
    <b>Post-traumatic seizures</b> (PTS) and <b>epilepsy</b> (PTE) are more common after contusions, DAI, or hematomas.

  <h1>Chapter 12: Functional Neuroimaging of TBI</h1>
  <h2>Overview and Paradigms</h2>
  <p>
    Functional neuroimaging assesses <b>brain activity and physiology</b>, not just anatomy. It complements exams and neuropsychological testing but remains largely <b>investigational</b> in TBI.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Resting paradigms</b> measure brain activity in baseline conditions—used in SPECT and PET. <b>Activation paradigms</b> require a task or stimulus, helpful in identifying regions involved in cognition or motor control.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>SPECT: Single Photon Emission CT</h2>
  <p>
    <b>SPECT</b> tracks <b>regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)</b> by detecting tracer uptake. It is cheaper and more available than PET but has <b>lower resolution</b> and <b>slower response to rapid changes</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In TBI, SPECT shows <b>reduced rCBF</b> in <b>frontal regions</b>, even when CT or MRI is normal. However, findings may lack specificity, and it is not approved for routine TBI assessment.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question-card">
  <h1>Question 10</h1>
  <p>Which finding is common in TBI on SPECT?</p>
  <ul class="options" id="options">
    <li data-answer="correct">Decreased blood flow in the prefrontal cortex</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">Increased metabolism in occipital cortex</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">Normal perfusion with structural damage</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>PET: Positron Emission Tomography</h2>
  <p>
    <b>PET</b> provides high-resolution maps of <b>metabolism</b> or <b>blood flow</b>. It uses radioactive tracers like <b>FDG</b> and often requires a <b>cyclotron</b>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In acute TBI, PET shows <b>hyperglycolysis</b> and <b>regional hypoperfusion</b>. Despite detailed imaging, few studies link PET findings to cognition due to logistical challenges and poor longitudinal data.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>fMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h2>
  <p>
    <b>fMRI</b> is based on the <b>BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent)</b> effect. Neural activity increases local oxyhemoglobin, enhancing the signal. It avoids radiation and offers <b>superior anatomic resolution</b> compared to SPECT or PET.
  </p>
  <p>
    In TBI, fMRI reveals <b>atypical activation patterns</b>—e.g., increased bilateral recruitment in working memory tasks. This suggests patients require more effort to achieve the same cognitive output.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question-card">
  <h1>Question 11</h1>
  <p>What does increased fMRI activation during tasks in TBI imply?</p>

  <h1>Chapter 13: Electrophysiologic Testing in TBI</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Evoked potentials</b> and <b>electroencephalography (EEG)</b> offer objective insight into brain function, independent of behavior or cooperation. They are especially useful for <b>early diagnosis</b> and <b>prognosis</b>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>Somatosensory and Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (SEP & BAEP)</h2>
  <p>
    <b>SEP</b> evaluates brain responses to sensory stimuli. Bilaterally absent cortical responses within 8 days in severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8) strongly predict poor outcomes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>BAEP</b> uses auditory clicks to assess brainstem function. Normal BAEPs in the first week predict awakening, but not necessarily cognitive recovery.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question-card">
  <h1>Question 12</h1>
  <p>What does bilaterally absent SEP indicate in severe TBI?</p>

    <li data-answer="wrong">Likely memory impairment</li>
    <li data-answer="wrong">Brainstem integrity</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="explanation-card">
  <h2>EEG and Event-Related Potentials</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Conventional EEG</b> identifies general brain dysfunction. Patterns like <b>non-reactive delta</b> or <b>burst suppression</b> suggest poor prognosis. In contrast, <b>quantitative EEG (QEEG)</b> offers better sensitivity in mild TBI, using frequency analysis and topographic mapping.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>P300</b> is an event-related potential that reflects attention and working memory. A preserved P300 in coma is highly predictive of recovery, while its absence does not guarantee poor outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>P50</b> indicates sensory gating, often disrupted in TBI. <b>P250</b>, a pain-related response, can help assess responsiveness in vegetative states.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion: Combining Imaging and Electrophysiology</h2>
  <p>
    SEP and P300 together enhance prognostication.
