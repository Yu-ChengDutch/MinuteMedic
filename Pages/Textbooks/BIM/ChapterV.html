<h1><strong>Chapter 5: Acute Care</strong></h1>

<p>This chapter provides a detailed overview of traumatic brain injury (TBI), covering its epidemiology, pathology, acute care management, and outcomes.</p>

<h2><strong>Epidemiology and Burden of TBI</strong>:</h2>
     <p>
       TBI is a<strong>significant public health problem</strong> in the United States, causing over 50,000 deaths annually and nearly 50% of all injury deaths. It is the leading cause of injury death and disability among children and young adults.
       Approximately 1.5 million Americans sustain a TBI yearly, with 250,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 to 90,000 individuals experiencing long-term disability. The total direct and indirect costs of TBI in 1995 were estimated at $56.3 billion.
       Recent data show a decline in TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths, partly due to a 40% reduction in motor vehicle accident deaths attributed to increased seat belt and safety equipment use. Additionally, changes in hospital admission practices mean more mild TBI patients are managed in outpatient settings.
           <strong>Leading causes of TBI-related hospital discharges</strong> in 1997 were motor-vehicle crashes (27.9/100,000), falls (22.5/100,000), and assaults (7.3/100,000).
           <strong>Highest rates</strong> were observed in American Indians and Alaska Natives (75.3/100,000) and Blacks (74.4/100,000), reflecting lower socioeconomic status, and males (91.9/100,000) had about twice the rate of females (47.7/100,000). Rates were also highest among those aged 15-19 and over 65, highlighting increased risk-taking in younger populations and the importance of TBI as a health problem among the elderly.>
     </p>
<h2><strong>Improvements in Mortality Rates</strong>:</h2>
     <p>Mortality rates for severe TBI have significantly decreased from approximately 50% in the 1970s to 30% in the 1990s, with a corresponding increase in the number of good to moderately disabled survivors. These improvements are attributed to better rescue systems, enhanced emergency and critical care, and rapid surgical treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring</strong>:</h2>
      <p><strong>ICP monitoring is a cornerstone in modern severe head injury management</strong>. It allows clinicians to intervene earlier to treat ICP elevations, which are associated with increased mortality.</p>

<h2><strong>Head Injury Morphology</strong>:</h2>
     <p>
       Head injuries are classified as<strong>blunt or penetrating</strong>.
          <strong>Blunt TBI</strong>, responsible for the majority of cases, includes motor vehicle accidents and falls. This can lead to<strong>coup injuries</strong> (at the site of impact) and<strong>contrecoup injuries</strong> (on the opposite side due to brain acceleration).
          <strong>Penetrating injuries</strong> involve bladed weapons and projectiles like handguns and assault rifles. These cause direct tissue crushing and laceration, form pulsating cavities, and can generate damaging pressure waves. They also carry a high risk of infection and have a dismal prognosis, with nearly 60% mortality for patients presenting alive to hospitals.
           <strong>Skull fractures</strong> are common in head injuries, indicating more severe injury and carrying a higher association with intracranial hemorrhages. Complications include infection (2-9% risk of meningitis), cerebrospinal fluid leaks (rhinorrhea or otorrhea), and a 31% long-term risk of late post-traumatic seizures with depressed fractures. Basilar skull fractures are associated with greater forces and classic signs like "raccoon eyes" and Battle's sign.
           <strong>Cerebral contusions</strong> typically occur in the frontal and temporal poles due to the brain striking bony surfaces.
           <strong>Epidural hemorrhages</strong> are usually lenticular-shaped, occur most commonly in the middle fossa, and are often associated with a skull fracture. They are important to identify early as they generally have a good outcome with less than 10% mortality if detected promptly.
           <strong>Acute subdural hemorrhages</strong> carry a poorer prognosis than epidural hemorrhages, often indicating more severe underlying brain damage. They typically result from torn bridging veins or hemorrhaging contusions and tend to cover the entire hemisphere.
           <strong>Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> is the most common cause of this type of bleeding and can lead to hydrocephalus.
           <strong>Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)</strong>, also known as shear injury, results from rotational forces and involves widespread damage to axons, often leading to prolonged depressed consciousness and severe disability. It is graded from 1 to 3, with Grade 3 lesions nearly always resulting in a comatose or vegetative state until death.
     </p>
<h2><strong>Concussion</strong>:</h2>
     <p>The term concussion describes a brain injury phenomenon following a mild to moderate TBI where imaging shows no hematoma or other intracranial pathology. Symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, difficulty concentrating, amnesia, and personality changes. Even mild TBI can result in widespread neuronal dysfunction and axonal injury.</p>
<h2><strong>Pathophysiology and Molecular Basis for Injury</strong>:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Primary injury</strong> occurs at the moment of impact and is not reversible, though associated contusions and hemorrhages can be treated surgically.
      <strong>Secondary injury</strong> involves a cascade of events after the initial insult, including edema, ischemia, necrosis, elevated ICP, and inadequate cerebral perfusion. At a cellular level, energy failure leads to elevated intracellular calcium, release of excitatory amino acids (like glutamate, causing excitotoxic injury), and generation of free radicals. While some agents (e.g., NMDA blockers, free radical scavengers) showed promise in animal models, human trials have largely failed, possibly due to timing of administration. Nitric oxide is also implicated in secondary injury.
    </p>
<h2><strong>Physiologic Response to Brain Injury</strong>:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Brain edema</strong> contributes to elevated ICP and cerebral ischemia.<strong>Vasogenic edema</strong> (disruption of blood-brain barrier) typically occurs early, while<strong>cytotoxic edema</strong> (cellular swelling due to ion homeostasis failure) occurs later. Edema is often maximal at 24 to 48 hours post-injury.
      <strong>Intracranial Pressure (ICP)</strong> is determined by the volume of brain parenchyma, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the closed skull. Once compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, ICP rises sharply. Sustained ICP above 20 mmHg is poorly tolerated and associated with increased mortality, risking cerebral ischemia and brain herniation.
      <strong>Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)</strong>, defined as Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) minus ICP (CPP = MAP - ICP), is critical for maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF). In severely head-injured patients, autoregulation of CBF can be impaired, and current recommendations are to<strong>maintain CPP between 60-70 mmHg</strong>.
    </p>
<h2><strong>Clinical Presentation and Acute Management</strong>:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prompt CT scanning of the brain</strong> is recommended for all patients with loss of consciousness or altered sensorium, especially intoxicated individuals, as it is the diagnostic procedure of choice for initial assessment of intracranial injury.
       TBI severity is conveniently classified using the<strong>Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)</strong>: mild (14-15), moderate (9-13), and severe (3-8).
      <strong>Pre-hospital care focuses on airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs)</strong>, preventing hypotension and hypoxia (which are associated with poor outcomes), and assessing GCS before sedation. Patients should be transported to facilities with CT scanning, neurosurgical expertise, and ICP monitoring capabilities. Spinal immobilization is also crucial due to the 4-8% association of TBI with cervical spine injury.
       In the emergency room, the<strong>Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol</strong> should be followed, prioritizing ABCs and controlling external bleeding. While fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (like normal saline) vs. colloids (like albumin) is debated, a large trial showed increased mortality in TBI patients receiving albumin.
       Neurologic assessment (GCS, pupillary exam) should precede sedation. Coagulopathy must be corrected if acute blood is seen on CT.
       Patients with mild TBI, normal neurological exams, and negative CT scans may be discharged safely, but others require admission for observation.
    </p>
<h2><strong>Surgical Treatment of Head Injury</strong>:</h2>
     <p>
       Operative therapy is indicated when<strong>intracerebral collections cause significant mass effect</strong>, traditionally defined as greater than 5 mm of midline shift.
       Specific surgical criteria include:
          <strong>Epidural hemorrhages</strong> greater than 30 cc, or smaller ones if the patient is symptomatic (e.g., GCS less than 9 with papillary dilation).
          <strong>Acute subdural hemorrhages</strong> greater than 1 cm in thickness or associated with more than 5 mm of midline shift require emergent evacuation.
          <strong>Intracerebral contusions</strong> with progressive neurologic deterioration or refractory intracranial hypertension, especially if large or causing significant mass effect.
          <strong>Open depressed skull fractures</strong> greater than the skull's thickness with dural laceration to reduce infection risk. Nonoperative management is an option for less severe closed or depressed fractures without dural penetration or significant hematoma. All open skull fractures should be treated with antibiotics.
     </p>
<h2><strong>ICP Monitoring and Treatment</strong>:</h2>
     <p>
       ICP monitoring is recommended for severe TBI patients (GCS <= 8) with abnormal head CT findings or specific risk factors even with a normal CT. Its use is associated with improved outcomes in retrospective studies, though direct prospective evidence is debated.
           <strong>Ventriculostomy</strong> is the preferred ICP monitoring method, allowing both pressure measurement and CSF drainage.
       An ICP threshold of 20-25 mmHg defines elevation, prompting a search for surgical mass lesions via repeat CT.
           <strong>Treatments for elevated ICP</strong> include elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees, preventing hyperthermia, mechanical ventilation, and sedation/paralysis.
           <strong>Corticosteroids are NOT recommended</strong> for TBI as a large trial showed increased mortality.
           <strong>Mannitol is a very effective drug for lowering ICP</strong> by dehydrating the brain. It is given as an intravenous bolus, with high doses preferred before surgery for acute hematomas. Serial serum osmolalities should be monitored to keep them below 320 mOsm to reduce the risk of renal failure.
           <strong>Hyperventilation</strong> should be reserved for established ICP elevations or refractory cases, and prophylactic use is discouraged due to risk of cerebral ischemia.
       Sedation (benzodiazepines, morphine) and paralytics can help manage ICP. Barbiturates are a last-line therapy for medically refractory hypertension, requiring EEG monitoring due to serious side effects.
           <strong>Decompressive craniectomy</strong> (unilateral or bilateral) is used for medically refractory ICP elevation or intraoperative brain swelling, though its benefit over maximal medical treatment remains controversial.
       While ICP elevation is detrimental,<strong>maintaining CPP at least 60 mmHg</strong> is important for preventing brain ischemia in patients with deranged autoregulation.
     </p>
<h2><strong>Critical Care and Additional Neuromonitoring Technologies</strong>:</h2>
     <p>
       Maintaining CPP >60 mmHg is a key goal in neurocritical care. Isotonic intravenous fluids (normal saline) are preferred, and dextrose-containing solutions are avoided as hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes.
           <strong>Glucose and electrolyte abnormalities</strong> (e.g., SIADH, diabetes insipidus, cerebral salt wasting) must be avoided as secondary insults.
           <strong>Seizures</strong> are a potential secondary insult; prophylactic treatment with phenytoin or carbamazepine for 1 week is recommended for at-risk TBI patients.
           <strong>Infection</strong> is a common ICU complication, with urinary tract infections being most frequent and pneumonia being the most common infectious cause of death. Prevention strategies include early tracheostomy, aggressive pulmonary hygiene, strict hand washing, and perioperative antibiotics.
           <strong>Early nutrition</strong> (within 2-3 days of injury, preferably via small intestine tube) is critical, as TBI patients have 40% increased caloric needs.
           <strong>Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)</strong> is common (up to 53.8%); sequential compression boots and subcutaneous heparin are recommended, with early use of heparin/LMWH shown to be safe in severe TBI.
           <strong>Additional neuromonitoring technologies</strong> used in selected centers include:
          <strong>Jugular bulb venous saturation monitoring</strong> to detect global oxygen consumption changes.
          <strong>Brain tissue oxygen tension monitors</strong> for regional oxygenation.
          <strong>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) monitoring</strong> using various experimental techniques, as reduced CBF is associated with worse outcomes.
          <strong>Continuous electroencephalography (EEG)</strong> to detect nonconvulsive status epilepticus and monitor barbiturate therapy.
     </p>
<h2><strong>Outcomes from Traumatic Brain Injury</strong>:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Mild TBI</strong> is often associated with<strong>postconcussive syndrome</strong>, characterized by cognitive, somatic, and affective symptoms. While two-thirds of patients improve by 3 months, some experience long-term disability, including depression and PTSD.
      <strong>Moderate TBI</strong> patients tend to improve, but many still experience significant cognitive and functional deficits, with only about 74% returning to work. They recover less completely and more slowly than those with mild TBI.
      <strong>Severe TBI</strong> mortality has decreased, and a majority of patients now have favorable outcomes, with fewer surviving in severe disability or vegetative states. Predictors of mortality include hypotension, hypoxia, lower GCS scores, older age, and certain CT findings.
       Despite improvements, few severe TBI survivors return to their premorbid functioning, and most experience<strong>significant cognitive and emotional sequelae</strong>. Major disability in social reintegration, employment, and relationships is common. Long-term problems include depression, decreased social contact, loneliness, hostility, and temper outbursts. These emotional difficulties contribute significantly to caregiver burden.
    </p>
<h2><strong>The Role of the Rehabilitation Specialist</strong>:</h2>
     <p>
       Rehabilitation specialists play a<strong>pivotal role</strong> in TBI treatment, directing appropriate rehabilitative services.
       For severe TBI,<strong>extensive and early rehabilitation</strong> is often needed, as it is associated with improved mobility and shorter acute rehabilitation stays.
       Rehabilitation includes acute care, inpatient rehabilitation focusing on preventing complications and compensating for disabilities, and a third phase aimed at achieving physical, domestic, and social independence and community re-entry.
       Rehabilitation specialists must be aware of potential reasons for readmission, such as orthopedic issues, infections, seizures, and post-traumatic hydrocephalus. Patients with severe TBI can continue to benefit from inpatient rehabilitation even after one year.

  <h1><strong>Chapter 19: Assessment, Early Rehabilitation Intervention, and Tertiary Prevention</strong></h1>
  
  <p>This chapter focuses on the critical role of physiatrists and early rehabilitation interventions in improving outcomes for TBI survivors, including assessment of impairments, prognosis, and prevention of long-term complications.</p> 
  <h2><strong>Societal Impact and Role of Rehabilitation</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         Approximately<strong>5.3 million Americans live with chronic physical, cognitive, and neurobehavioral impairments</strong> from TBI, leading to an annual economic impact of about $25 billion for direct care. TBI primarily affects young adults, and most survivors of moderate and severe TBI are left with permanent impairments.
               <strong>Early and comprehensive rehabilitative interventions</strong> are crucial for attenuating impairments, preventing complications, and maximizing functional outcomes. Research supports the importance of enriched environments and physical activity for neurogenesis and cell survival, and highlights the negative impact of chemical and physical restraints on recovery.
         The<strong>initial physiatric evaluation should ideally occur within the first 24 hours</strong> of injury, emphasizing that rehabilitation is an integral part of acute recovery, not just a final stage.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Physiatrist's Initial Evaluation</strong>:</h2>
       <p>The physiatrist considers assessing residual impairments, estimating prognosis, initiating early rehabilitation interventions (focusing on complication prevention and preparing for ongoing needs), and formulating a long-term treatment plan.</p>
  <h2><strong>Assessment of Residual Impairments</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         Impairments are broadly categorized as<strong>physical, cognitive, and neurobehavioral</strong>. While a comprehensive assessment may be challenging in coma-emerging patients, attention is directed to prognostic and immediate rehabilitation-impacting impairments.
               <strong>Associated injuries</strong>, especially fractures, are common (60% of TBI patients) and significantly impact survival and functional outcomes.
               <strong>Physical consequences</strong> critical for assessment include issues with swallowing, communication, mobility, and locomotion.
               <strong>Cognitive deficits</strong> have a greater long-term functional impact than physical deficits. Screening focuses on communication and learning basic functional skills.
               <strong>Neurobehavioral sequelae</strong>, particularly<strong>agitation</strong>, can profoundly impact long-term outcome and influence the type of initial rehabilitation services.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Prognosis after TBI</strong>:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>No single variable can accurately predict TBI outcome</strong> due to its complexity. The predictive value of variables depends on the specific outcome of interest (e.g., rehabilitation readiness vs. vocational outcome).
        <strong>Age at injury is the most powerful premorbid prognostic indicator</strong> for mortality and functional outcome, with dramatically increased mortality and poorer outcomes in older patients, even when controlling for injury severity.
        <strong>Type of central nervous system lesion</strong> correlates with survival and functional outcome; mass lesions, especially subdural hematomas, imply higher mortality and poorer functional outcomes. CT scan findings like third ventricle/basal cistern abnormalities (indicating elevated ICP) and temporal lobe lesions with significant midline shift also carry negative prognostic implications.
        <strong>Coma duration</strong> is an important severity marker and a better predictor of motor and cognitive recovery than coma depth, with longer durations correlating with worse 1-year functional outcomes.
        <strong>Coma depth</strong>, measured by the GCS, is a prognostic indicator for mortality and, to a lesser extent, functional outcome. Early GCS scores (within 24 hours) are better for survival prediction, while scores 2-3 days post-injury are better for functional outcome. More aggressive resuscitation may affect the predictive value of admission GCS scores.
        <strong>Duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)</strong> has a strong relationship with outcome, predicting functional outcome, return to work, post-traumatic epilepsy, and cognitive recovery. Shorter PTA (<2 weeks) is associated with good recovery, while longer PTA (>4 weeks) implies a very poor prognosis for functional independence. The relationship is most prominent in diffuse axonal injury.
        <strong>Secondary brain injuries</strong>, especially<strong>hypotension</strong> (systolic BP less than 90 mmHg or CPP less than 70 mmHg), are highly detrimental to survival and functional outcome. Raised intracranial pressure is also a strong predictor of poor outcome.
         Impairments and extent of disability at the time of rehabilitation presentation, such as CT scan abnormalities and initial FIM scores, are also useful predictors of functional outcome and rehabilitation length of stay.
      </p>
  <h2><strong>Early Rehabilitation Intervention</strong>:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Early and aggressive rehabilitation significantly improves functional outcome</strong>. Delayed multidisciplinary rehabilitation is linked to longer hospitalizations and poorer outcomes.
         Early physiatric involvement leads to earlier initiation of rehabilitation and better functional outcomes.
      </p>
  <h2><strong>Management of the Minimally Responsive Patient</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         The<strong>Rancho Los Amigos Scale of Cognitive Functioning</strong> is a behavioral observation tool used to categorize a patient's cognitive level (Levels I-VIII) and guide rehabilitation strategies.
               <strong>Coma rehabilitation or multisensory stimulation programs</strong> are designed for minimally responsive patients to prevent complications and maximize emergence. However, clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of multisensory programs over standard multidisciplinary rehabilitation is limited.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Post-Traumatic Amnesia (PTA)</strong>:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>PTA is a universal form of delirium</strong> in moderate and severe TBI survivors, characterized by disorientation, confusion, diminished memory, and reduced environmental responsiveness.
         While acquisition and storage of new information are impaired during PTA, patients can still learn new functional skills through consistent and repetitious behavioral interventions.
         The<strong>duration of PTA is a key marker of injury severity and prognosis</strong>.
         The<strong>Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT)</strong> is the most widely utilized and reliable prospective instrument for assessing PTA duration, especially suitable for acute care settings.
      </p>
  <h2><strong>Agitation</strong>:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Post-traumatic agitation</strong> is a common and dramatic behavioral disorder during PTA (Rancho Level IV), characterized by restlessness, aggression, and emotional lability.
        <strong>Initial management involves a comprehensive examination</strong> to rule out other medical or neurological causes like untreated pain, infections, or adverse drug reactions. It's noted that cognition typically improves before agitation resolves.
         Management strategies include one-to-one monitoring, behavioral modification, physical restraints, environmental modification, and pharmacologic intervention.
         While several drug classes (e.g., beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics) are used, their efficacy and impact on cognitive recovery are still being investigated, with some evidence suggesting neuroleptics may negatively affect cognitive recovery. The ideal medication controls behavior without sedation and augments cognition.
      </p>
  <h2><strong>Cardiovascular Autonomic Disorders</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         Common post-TBI, particularly<strong>hypertension</strong> (15-33% incidence), especially after brainstem or diffuse axonal injury. Symptoms include fluctuating hypertension, fever, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and dystonia.
         Diagnosis is by exclusion. Autonomic dysfunction is associated with increased morbidity (e.g., myocardial infarction) and can delay rehabilitation.
         Hypotension in rehabilitation is often due to prolonged bed rest, medications, or volume depletion.
         ECG abnormalities and myocardial injury are common, potentially due to massive catecholamine release.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Respiratory Disorders</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         These are the<strong>most frequent complications</strong> during acute trauma and rehabilitation. Pneumonia (up to 60%), respiratory failure (up to 43%), and tracheotomies (39%) are common.
         Pulmonary complications are a major cause of preventable deaths and are strongly associated with longer hospital stays and poorer outcomes.
               <strong>Alcohol intoxication</strong> is a significant risk factor for respiratory complications due to immune suppression and increased aspiration risk.
         Decannulation protocols are not standardized, and serious laryngotracheal abnormalities (e.g., stenosis) are common after prolonged intubation. Predictors of successful decannulation include traumatic injury mechanism, younger age, and alert cognitive status.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Fever</strong>:</h2>
       <p>A common acute complication. Potential sources after TBI include<strong>urinary tract infections</strong> (40% during rehab),<strong>pulmonary infections</strong> (e.g., pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia),<strong>head and neck infections</strong> (e.g., perinasal sinusitis, dental abscess),<strong>cardiovascular etiologies</strong> (e.g., IV line sepsis, thromboembolic disease),<strong>musculoskeletal issues</strong> (e.g., heterotopic ossification, osteomyelitis), and<strong>neurologic causes</strong> (e.g., meningitis, hydrocephalus-related hyperthermia).</p>
  <h2><strong>Bladder and Bowel Function</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         Frontal lobe injury can cause loss of cortical control over urination and defecation.<strong>Urinary incontinence</strong> is common (62% in first 6 weeks) and increases the risk of UTIs and skin ulcers, leading to poorer functional outcomes. Timed voiding programs and addressing predisposing factors are key treatments. Anticholinergic agents can be used but may impair cognition.
               <strong>Bowel dysfunction</strong> includes incontinence and constipation due to immobility and medications. Diarrhea is common with enteral feedings.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Swallowing and Nutrition</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         TBI survivors experience<strong>hypermetabolism and increased caloric/protein needs</strong> for up to 4 weeks.<strong>Early nutritional support prevents immune loss, decreases morbidity/mortality, and may reduce disability</strong>.
               <strong>Swallowing disorders affect 25-30%</strong> of survivors, requiring assessment by a speech-language pathologist or occupational therapist, often with videofluoroscopy, as physical findings alone are unreliable. Oral feeding begins therapeutically, with close monitoring for behavioral issues and nutritional status.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Spasticity, Dystonia, and Other Muscle Overactivity</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         These can affect limbs, torso, face, and oral pharyngeal muscles. Treatment is warranted if tone interferes with rehabilitation goals.
               <strong>Treatment stages</strong>: Physical modalities (e.g., cryotherapy), range of motion exercises, and<strong>serial casting</strong> (effective for tone reduction and joint ROM).
         If these are insufficient,<strong>pharmacologic therapy</strong> (e.g., dantrolene sodium, tizanidine, baclofen, benzodiazepines) is used, but requires monitoring for cognitive side effects. More invasive interventions (e.g., botulinum toxin, nerve blocks, neurectomies, intrathecal baclofen) are rarely indicated in early rehabilitation.
       </p>
  <h2><strong>Tertiary Prevention</strong>:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)</strong>: A significant source of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of DVT after severe TBI is estimated at 40%, with fatal pulmonary embolus at 1%. Prophylaxis (pneumatic compression devices, low molecular weight heparin) is increasingly supported as safe within 24-72 hours post-injury, despite initial concerns about anticoagulation.
        <strong>Contractures</strong>: A major risk for immobilized and severely injured patients, especially with altered muscle tone. Prevention through range of motion exercises and postural adaptation is key, with serial casting being a useful tool. Surgical release may be considered for severe, chronic contractures.
        <strong>Fractures</strong>: Concurrent fractures are present in about 30% of TBI patients. They carry a high risk of developing heterotopic ossification (HO), especially hip and forearm fractures. Early definitive fixation of fractures allows for earlier mobilization, which reduces the likelihood of severe spasticity, contractures, and HO.
        <strong>Peripheral Nerve Injuries (PNIs)</strong>: Approximately 34% of patients admitted to rehabilitation units have previously undetected PNIs, with ulnar, brachial plexus, and common peroneal nerve injuries being common. Many PNIs are preventable through proper positioning, cast monitoring, and early treatment of spasticity and HO.
        <strong>Heterotopic Ossification (HO)</strong>: Occurs in 20% of TBI survivors, with increased risk in severe injuries, prolonged immobilization, coma, spasticity, and fractures. HO can significantly limit joint range of motion. Preventive strategies include diphosphonates and indomethacin. Aggressive range of motion exercises are used, but their role is debated. Surgery is a last resort for severe ankylosis, typically performed after 1-2 years post-onset to minimize recurrence.
      </p>
  <h2><strong>Individualized Rehabilitation Plan</strong>:</h2>
       <p>
         Rehabilitation options depend on residual impairments and progress.
               <strong>Outpatient or day-treatment programs</strong> are for those recovering sufficiently for home management.
               <strong>Acute rehabilitation programs</strong> are for dependent patients who can tolerate at least 3 hours of therapy daily, focusing on regaining independence in activities of daily living.
               <strong>Subacute rehabilitation programs</strong> are nursing home-based and suitable for patients who are less responsive or progress slowly, not requiring 3 hours of daily therapy.
         Specialized inpatient behavioral treatment programs are indicated for severe behavioral problems.
               <strong>Transitional living programs</strong> are residential alternatives for those with primarily cognitive/neurobehavioral deficits preventing independent living.
               <strong>Vocational rehabilitation</strong> is a later stage, focusing on return to work.
