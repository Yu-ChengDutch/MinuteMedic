    <h1>### Chapter 34: Complications Associated with Immobility after TBI</h1>
    
    <p>This chapter introduces the pervasive and detrimental effects of prolonged immobilization on human physiology, a phenomenon recognized since ancient times and further clarified by modern space program studies mimicking microgravity. It emphasizes that in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), these effects are compounded and worsened by TBI-specific disorders like posturing, spasticity, and endocrine abnormalities, highlighting the critical need for prevention, prompt management, and early patient mobilization.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The chapter details the impact of immobility on multiple body systems:</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <br><br><b>Deconditioning</b> is presented as a significant diagnosis resulting from reduced functional capacity of both musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems. Studies on healthy individuals underscore the importance of early mobilization for patients with illness or injury.
        <br><br><b>Musculoskeletal System</b>:
            <br><b>Significant changes</b> occur within 4–6 weeks of immobilization, including up to 40% muscle strength loss, decreased bone density, and shortening of collagenous tissues, due to lack of weight-bearing and reduced muscle contraction. These effects are magnified in vulnerable populations like the elderly.
            <br><b>Bone Density Loss</b> is a complex process where immobilization disrupts the balance between osteoclast (bone resorption) and osteoblast (bone synthesis) activity, leading to a negative calcium balance within a week. TBI patients, especially those with hemiplegia, are at higher risk. Recovery of bone density is slow, and interventions like vitamin D, calcium, etidronate, and clenbuterol are explored for prevention.
            <br><b>Muscle Weakness and Atrophy</b> manifest rapidly, particularly in weight-bearing lower limb muscles. This is driven by increased protein breakdown (marked by nitrogen excretion) and decreased protein synthesis. The disruption of antioxidant protection further accelerates muscle damage. While animal studies often show slow-twitch fiber atrophy, human studies point to fast-twitch fibers being more affected. Isometric exercise, clenbuterol, and creatine supplementation are suggested for prevention.
            <br><b>Decreased Muscle Strength and Endurance</b> are direct consequences, with substantial reductions in strength (e.g., 18–20% in knee extensors after 30 days) and endurance, which may not fully recover. This is linked to changes in muscle oxidative enzymes, reduced oxygen delivery, and decreased efficiency of motor neuron recruitment, though neuromuscular inefficiencies can be reversed with training.
            <br><b>Joint Contractures</b> arise from changes in connective tissue and muscle, leading to a loss of passive range of motion. TBI patients face additional risk factors such as spasticity, rigidity, and prolonged abnormal postures. Prevention strategies include proper joint positioning with splints, effective spasticity management, and frequent active and passive range of motion exercises, with standing and prone lying being particularly beneficial. Serial casting can be used to treat existing contractures.
        <br><br><b>Respiratory System</b>: TBI patients, especially those with tracheostomies or impaired alertness, are prone to pulmonary complications. Prolonged bedrest further increases this risk by reducing lung capacity and pulmonary blood flow, predisposing to atelectasis and infection. Early mobilization and aggressive pulmonary hygiene are crucial.
        <br><br><b>Cardiovascular System</b>: Immobility significantly impacts the cardiovascular system. Prolonged horizontal positioning causes fluid redistribution, leading to diuresis and plasma volume loss. Upon resuming upright posture, this results in orthostatic hypotension due to sudden decreases in ventricular filling and stroke volume, and attenuated baroreflex responses. TBI-related autonomic dysfunction can exacerbate these issues. Aerobic capacity decreases, and heart rate increases for a given oxygen demand. The ventricles may become less distensible. Decreased red blood cell mass and reduced blood flow to leg muscles contribute to fatigability. Reversal requires upright positioning, adequate hydration, and exercise.
            <br><b>Thrombogenesis</b>: Thromboembolic disease is a major risk, with TBI patients often presenting with all three components of Virchow's triad (stasis, endothelial damage, hypercoagulable state). Hemiparesis further contributes to stasis. Diagnosis is challenging as physical exams are unreliable; venous duplex exams are standard, but D-dimer tests are less useful in TBI due to non-specific elevation. Treatment with anticoagulants like heparin is often complicated by intracranial hemorrhage or fall risk, making retrievable inferior vena cava filters a consideration, though they carry their own risks. Prophylaxis is critical.
        <br><br><b>Integumentary System</b>: Pressure ulcers are a common and costly complication associated with increased mortality and morbidity, particularly in patients with paresis or decreased body weight. They primarily result from inadequate tissue perfusion due to unrelieved pressure at bony prominences.
        <br><br><b>Neurological Systems</b>: Prolonged bedrest has negative impacts on cognitive and psychiatric functions, leading to increased depression, emotional distress, confusion, and depressed cognitive test scores, as observed in space program research. It can also perpetuate chronic insomnia and sleep disorders. Neuromuscular changes contribute to balance disorders and incoordination, including increased postural sway, gait changes, and impaired kinesthetic sense. Cortical responses may be reduced proportionally to the immobilization period.
        <br><br><b>Endocrine and Metabolic System</b>: While direct TBI-specific literature is limited, chronic illness and immobilization are linked to growth hormone resistance, elevated corticosterone levels, and disturbances in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium balance. Nitrogen loss is also a prominent feature. Volume-regulating systems are affected, leading to sodium, chloride, and potassium excretion.
        <br><br><b>Gastrointestinal and Urologic Systems</b>: Intestinal absorption (especially calcium) decreases during bedrest. Gastroesophageal reflux risk is heightened in TBI patients due to dysphagia, tube feeding, and bedrest, potentially leading to esophageal damage. Urinary stasis, characterized by reduced urinary flow and increased post-void residuals, is also associated with the recumbent position.
        <br><br><b>Prevention of Complications</b>: The chapter concludes by emphasizing that any mobilization is beneficial. While isotonic and isokinetic exercises can maintain cardiac function and fluid balance, they may not impact cognitive functions or orthostatic tolerance. Careful, graduated remobilization is advised, particularly for elderly TBI patients where bone density issues are magnified. Maintaining adequate hydration, nutrition, and proper limb/trunk positioning are crucial for preventing contractures and facilitating neurological recovery.

    <h1>### Chapter 35: Assessing and Treating Muscle Overactivity in the Upper Motoneuron Syndrome</h1>
    
    <p>This chapter focuses on the assessment and treatment of "muscle overactivity," a collective term for positive signs in Upper Motoneuron Syndrome (UMNS). The authors introduce muscle stiffness and contracture as a "third sign" of UMNS, arguing that these rheologic changes often cause more dysfunction than classic positive or negative signs, emphasizing their importance in clinical management.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The chapter categorizes and describes various forms of muscle overactivity:
        <br>
        <br><br><b>Spasticity</b> is strictly defined as an increase in velocity-dependent stretch reflexes and exaggerated tendon jerks. Clinically, it presents as increased resistance to passive stretch that intensifies with stretch velocity, sometimes resulting in a "spastic catch". Physiologically, it is attributed to a heightened central excitatory state in the spinal cord and "signal mishandling" mechanisms. While easily observed on EMG, its true functional impact may be less frequent in daily life compared to other overactivity forms, as caregivers often avoid fast stretches.
        <br><br><b>Clonus</b> is a low-frequency (6-8 Hz) rhythmic oscillation, triggered by rapid muscle stretch or unintentional positioning. It is characterized by repetitive bursts of electrical activity. Dantrolene sodium is noted as particularly effective for dampening these oscillations.
        <br><br><b>Co-contraction</b> involves the simultaneous activation of agonist and antagonist muscles during voluntary movement. It is distinct from spasticity as it is not necessarily stretch-induced and is linked to supraspinal control of reciprocal inhibition. Patients with co-contraction exhibit slow, effortful, and asymmetrical movements. Treatment often involves weakening strategies such as chemodenervation or tendon lengthenings.
        <br><br><b>Flexor and Extensor Spasms</b> are disinhibited polysynaptic reflexes elicited by various afferent stimuli (cutaneous, nociceptive, muscle spindle). They result in coordinated muscle contractions across multiple joints, often triggered by overt or covert stimuli (e.g., full bladder). While drugs like baclofen and diazepam can reduce their frequency and intensity, they may have problematic sedative or cognitive side effects in TBI patients.
        <br><br><b>Spastic Dystonia</b> refers to fixed limb postures maintained by continuous muscle contraction, primarily due to abnormal supraspinal drive and an inability to inhibit muscle activity. Unlike spasticity, it's not necessarily spinal reflex-mediated, but dystonic muscles can be stretch-sensitive. Diagnosis is best supported by EMG demonstrating tonic muscle activity at rest. Treatment strategies often involve focal interventions like botulinum toxin, phenol neurolysis, or dantrolene.
        <br><br><b>Associated Reactions</b> are involuntary movements in one limb occurring with voluntary effort in other limbs, thought to be due to disinhibited spread of motor activity or impaired descending commands. Their intensity correlates with the magnitude of voluntary effort. These reactions may contribute significantly to muscle stiffness and contracture in daily activities.
        <br><br><b>Muscle Stiffness and Contracture</b> represent the physical shortening of muscle and other soft tissues, an invariant state that persists even if muscle contraction is blocked. This is promoted by paresis, gravity, and persistent muscle overactivity. Unlike dynamic muscle overactivity, contractures do not respond to pharmacological agents that affect muscle contraction and require physical or surgical interventions. Research indicates intrinsic structural remodeling of muscle tissue in chronic spasticity, making reversal challenging.
        
        <br>The chapter also outlines the <b>Approach to Evaluation and Treatment</b>:
        
        <br><br><b>Evaluation</b> focuses on identifying the specific clinical pattern of motor dysfunction, the patient's voluntary muscle control, and the degree of muscle stiffness and contracture. This involves a combination of clinical examination, advanced technology like dynamic electromyography (EMG), kinematic and kinetic measurements, and temporary nerve blocks to differentiate between overactivity and fixed contracture. The authors stress that clinical examination alone is often insufficient for a detailed assessment.
        <br><br><b>Motor Recovery</b> after TBI is typically expected to wind down within 6-12 months, but functional recovery through interventions can occur much later.
        <br><br><b>Treatment Perspectives</b> emphasize focal analysis of muscle problems rather than diffuse approaches. Historically, physical rehabilitation for TBI was less emphasized, and drugs were used cautiously due to side effects. The authors advocate for effective conservative and surgical methods.
        
        <br>Detailed sections on <b>Patterns of UMN Motor Dysfunction</b> follow, outlining specific deformities in the upper and lower limbs (e.g., adducted shoulder, flexed elbow, flexed wrist, clenched fist, thumb-in-palm, flexed hip, adducted hip, stiff knee, flexed knee, equinovarus foot). For each pattern, the chapter describes signs/symptoms, functional consequences, contributing muscles, differential diagnosis methods (including dynamic EMG, radiographs, and nerve blocks), and findings leading to specific treatment options (pharmacological, chemodenervation, neurolysis, and surgical).
        
        <br><br><b>Pharmacological Interventions</b>:
        <br><b>Dantrolene Sodium</b> acts peripherally by inhibiting calcium release in muscle fibers, useful for low-frequency spasticity like clonus but less effective for severe, tonic overactivity. It can cause sedation and hepatotoxicity.
        <br><b>Diazepam</b> is a central depressant that enhances GABA's inhibitory effects in the spinal cord. While reducing spasticity, its significant sedation makes it unsuitable for TBI patients with cognitive impairment.
        <br><b>Baclofen</b>, a GABA agonist, inhibits alpha motor neuron activity in the spinal cord. Oral baclofen is effective for spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis but its central side effects (drowsiness, confusion) limit its utility in TBI. Intrathecal baclofen delivery allows lower doses and reduced side effects, particularly useful for regional lower extremity overactivity, but carries risks of overdose and withdrawal.
        <br><b>Tizanidine</b> acts as an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist at spinal and supraspinal levels, reducing muscle response to passive stretch. It causes sedation in a high percentage of patients, limiting its therapeutic effect for TBI.
        <br><b>Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT)</b> is highly valued for its focal action and minimal systemic side effects. Injected directly into muscles, it causes reversible, dose-dependent relaxation by blocking acetylcholine release. It improves passive and active range of motion and facilitates stretching. BoNT-A (Botox®) and BoNT-B (MyoBloc) are available. Benefits typically appear in 3-7 days and last 3-4 months.
        
        <br><br><b>Nerve Blocks</b>:
        <br><b>Diagnostic blocks</b> use short-acting local anesthetics to temporarily reduce muscle overactivity, allowing clinicians to assess underlying issues like contracture, potential for active movement, and functional improvement, aiding in treatment planning and outcome prediction.
        <br><b>Therapeutic blocks</b> typically use aqueous phenol solutions, which denature protein in nerve axons. Phenol blocks can last for several months and are considered a temporizing measure during neurological recovery, facilitating rehabilitation efforts like casting and range of motion exercises. The chapter compares phenol and BoNT, noting differences in cost, onset of effect, and duration.
        
        <br>Finally, a <b>Special Section on Neuro-Orthopaedic Principles, Selected Procedures, and Post-Operative Rehabilitation</b> details surgical interventions:
        
        <br><br><b>Principles</b> emphasize early surgical intervention (6+ months post-TBI for stability), focusing on improving functional outcomes by correcting deformities and rebalancing muscle forces. Surgery aims to improve joint range, reduce unwanted force, and unmask latent motor control, with careful preoperative evaluation being crucial. The cost of surgery is considered modest compared to the long-term costs of untreated deformities.
        <br>Specific surgical techniques are described for various deformities:
            <br>- <b>Shoulder</b>: Anterior shoulder release for contracture (pectoralis major, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, teres major), selective shoulder lengthenings for active function, and supraspinatus slide for abduction posturing. Post-operative rehabilitation varies but often involves early active motion without passive stretching.
            <br>- <b>Elbow</b>: Selective flexor lengthening (biceps, brachialis, brachioradialis) for active function, and elbow flexor release for passive function (contracture, ulnar nerve compression). Gradual extension via serial casting may follow release. Ulnar nerve transposition may be performed for compression.
            <br>- <b>Forearm</b>: Fractional lengthening of pronator teres and pronator quadratus to improve supination. Early active exercises post-op.
            <br>- <b>Wrist</b>: Fractional wrist flexor lengthening for volitional control. For severe deformities or lack of active function, wrist flexor release and wrist fusion (often with carpal tunnel release) are options.
            <br>- <b>Hand</b>: Fractional lengthening of extrinsic finger flexors (FDS, FDP) for clenched fist. Superficialis to profundus tendon transfer (STP) for severe, non-functional clenched fists, often combined with other releases and wrist fusion.
            <br>- <b>Thumb</b>: Thenar muscle slide for thumb-in-palm deformity (flexor pollicis longus, adductor pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis).
            <br>- <b>Pelvis and Hip</b>: Resection of heterotopic ossification (HO) (anterior, medial, posterior, lateral) which often encases neurovascular structures. Obturator neurectomy or hip adductor tenotomy for scissoring thighs/adduction contractures. Functional or non-functional hip flexor releases (iliopsoas, rectus femoris, pectineus) for crouch gait or hygiene issues.
            <br>- <b>Knee</b>: Distal hamstring lengthening for knee flexion deformities with volitional activity. Distal hamstring release for severe contractures. Rectus femoris to gracilis transfer for dynamic stiff knee gait. Post-operative casting and rehabilitation protocols are detailed for each procedure.
            <br>- <b>Foot and Ankle</b>: Achilles tendon lengthening for equinus deformity. Split Anterior Tibialis Tendon Transfer (SPLATT) for varus deformity caused by tibialis anterior overactivity. Tibialis posterior lengthening for varus. Transfer of the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) to os calcis to augment calf strength and increase brace-free ambulation. Post-operative casting, bracing, and gait training are specified for each procedure.
        
        <br><br>The chapter concludes by highlighting the importance of tailored rehabilitation after surgical interventions to optimize functional outcomes and prevent recurrence of deformities.
