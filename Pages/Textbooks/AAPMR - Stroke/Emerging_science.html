        <h1>### Introduction</h1>
        <p>Stroke affects 12.2 million people annually worldwide and is the leading cause of adult-acquired disability.
            While recent advances in stroke treatment, especially for ischemic strokes, have increased survival rates,
            stroke survivors often endure long-term neurological complications. These complications can occur days to
            years after a stroke, often interact with each other, and have complex impacts on mortality and functional
            recovery. Beyond commonly addressed motor and language impairments, other complications like cognitive
            impairment, epilepsy, depression, fatigue, tremors, dysphagia, and pain require further attention,
            particularly regarding updated diagnostic and treatment approaches. This review explores recent advances in
            the diagnosis and treatment of these specific post-stroke complications.</p>

        <h1>### Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment (PSCI)</h1>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Prevalence and Impact:</b>
            <br> <b>Cognitive impairment is frequent after a stroke</b>.
            <br> Dementia, the extreme end of cognitive impairment, affects up to one in three stroke survivors.
            <br> Dementia after stroke is associated with a <b>2 to 6 times higher adjusted mortality rate</b>, a higher
            rate of stroke recurrence, and poor functional outcomes.
            <br> Mild cognitive impairment (early PSCI) doubles the risk of death in stroke survivors.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors:</b>
            <br> Classical predictors include a history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, the number and size of stroke
            lesions, stroke type (higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke), and stroke severity.
            <br> Stroke consequences and sequelae like dysphasia, incontinence, and seizures are also independent
            predictors of dementia after stroke.
            <br> Atrial fibrillation, a common stroke risk factor in the elderly, increases the risk of dementia in
            individuals without pre-existing stroke by about 50% and is associated with silent infarcts that impact
            cognitive function.
            <br> <b>Emerging predictor:</b> Onset of seizures. Early seizures are linked to a nearly fourfold increased
            risk of new-onset post-stroke dementia among elderly survivors. Late-onset seizures increase the risk of
            subsequent dementia in young stroke survivors by 2.5 times.

            <br><br><b>Diagnostic Tools:</b>
            <br> There are no specific tools for screening and diagnosing PSCI.
            <br> <b>Brain imaging biomarkers</b> include silent infarcts, whose effects may not be apparent for several
            years.
            <br> The appearance of new MRI lesions is associated with abrupt cognitive decline.

            <br><br><b>Prevention and Treatment:</b>
            <br> Most prevention focuses on mitigating stroke risk factors.
            <br> Specific interventions beyond traditional approaches are needed.
            <br> Actovegin, a neuroprotective agent, improved post-stroke cognition in a trial, but the study had
            limitations due to missing data.
            <br> Secondary prevention remains the mainstay of management.
            <br> Identifying and treating other stroke-related long-term complications like seizures could potentially
            reverse the course of dementia.
            <br> Neuroprotective agents could improve post-stroke cognition.
        </p>

        <h2>### Post-stroke Epilepsy (PSE)</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Prevalence and Impact:</b>
            <br> Seizures occur in about <b>4% of stroke survivors within a year</b> and 1 in 10 within 10 years.
            <br> The risk of post-stroke epilepsy is 1.5 to 2 times higher in hemorrhagic stroke than in ischemic
            stroke.
            <br> Stroke patients are 10 times more likely to visit emergency rooms or be hospitalized for seizures
            compared to the general population.
            <br> PSE increases the risk of <b>death, functional disability, impaired cognitive functioning, and lower
                disease-specific quality of life</b>.
            <br> Stroke is a major cause of epilepsy, accounting for approximately one-third of all newly diagnosed
            epilepsy cases in patients aged 60 and above.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors:</b>
            <br> Predictive factors include <b>cortical involvement, large infarcts, and hemorrhagic transformation</b>.
            Hemorrhagic stroke versus ischemic stroke is also a factor.
            <br> One in four patients with small vessel disease experiences seizures.
            <br> Small vessel disease and white matter disease are more prevalent in patients with seizures.
            <br> Cortical microbleeds, seen in hemorrhagic strokes and possibly ischemic strokes, amplify the risk of
            developing PSE.
            <br> Acute reperfusion treatments, such as mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT),
            were <b>not associated with an increased risk of seizures</b>.

            <br><br><b>Diagnostic and Prediction Tools:</b>
            <br> The <b>SeLECT model</b> (Severity of stroke, Large-artery atherosclerotic etiology, Early seizures,
            Cortical Involvement, and Territory of middle cerebral artery involvement) is the only rigorously developed
            tool to predict seizures after ischemic stroke.
            <br> The SeLECT model indicates varying probabilities of seizures based on parameters like stroke severity
            and cortical involvement. It has a C-statistic of 77%, suggesting it can correctly discriminate between
            those who will and will not develop seizures 77% of the time.
            <br> No risk prediction tool for late-onset seizures in post-hemorrhagic stroke meets good model development
            requirements.

            <br><br><b>Treatment:</b>
            <br> There is <b>insufficient evidence to support the prophylactic use of antiseizure drugs</b> for primary
            or secondary seizure prevention in stroke survivors.
            <br> A study testing acute diazepam administration for seizure prevention showed limited effect.
            <br> A small trial suggests that <b>Levetiracetam may reduce the risk of acute symptomatic seizures</b> in
            patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

            <br><br><b>Future Directions:</b>
            <br> There is a need to develop rigorous predictive risk prediction tools for early and late-onset seizures
            after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
            <br> Clinical trials are needed to develop antiepileptogenic drugs after stroke and to define strategies for
            preventing and treating early and late seizures.
        </p>

        <h2>### Post-stroke Depression (PSD)</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Prevalence and Impact:</b>
            <br> PSD affects <b>11% to 41% of stroke survivors globally</b>.
            <br> It is associated with a <b>significant increase in mortality risk, approximately 50%</b>.
            <br> There is insufficient data on the association between PSD and the risk of stroke recurrence.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors:</b>
            <br> Well-known clinical risk factors include a <b>history of depression, stroke severity, left hemispheric
                stroke lesions, and lack of social support</b>.
            <br> Novel biomarkers like elevated growth differentiation factor-15, anticardiolipin antibodies,
            antiphosphatidylserine antibodies, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 show promise for risk prediction,
            distinguishing depression risk in stroke patients with 75% accuracy. However, these are not yet routinely
            used in clinical practice.

            <br><br><b>Screening Tools:</b>
            <br> Screening relies on validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Beck’s
            Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton’s Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) questionnaires, though these may
            lack stroke-specificity.
            <br> <b>The Post-Stroke Depression Prediction Scale is more specific</b> (78% accuracy) and allows for
            differentiation of PSD subtypes (Post-Stroke Depression Symptoms Disorder and Post-Stroke Depression
            Disorder). This scale has shown greater reliability and validity than PHQ-9.

            <br><br><b>Treatment:</b>
            <br> <b>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the primary pharmacological treatment</b> for
            PSD and can also prevent its development.
            <br> Non-pharmacological and non-invasive approaches are highly desirable due to the risk of
            non-stroke-related medical complications (e.g., bone fractures, hospital readmissions) with antidepressants.
            <br> <b>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)</b> is an increasingly accepted
            non-pharmacological option.
            <br> Combining SSRIs with rTMS therapy has shown <b>synergistic effects</b> in improving PSD symptoms.
            <br> Ideally, PSD treatment plans are multifaceted, considering the risks and benefits of each option.

            <br><br><b>Future Directions:</b>
            <br> Stroke-specific depression scales are needed.
            <br> Non-pharmacological approaches should be further explored due to potential non-stroke-related
            complications.

        </p>
        <h2>### Post-stroke Fatigue (PSF)</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Definition and Prevalence:</b>
            <br> PSF is conceptually defined as a <b>"sensation of exhaustion during or after usual activities, or a
                feeling of inadequate energy to begin these activities"</b>, despite the lack of a consensual
            definition.
            <br> It is one of the most frequent post-stroke complications, with nearly <b>half of stroke survivors
                reporting symptoms of fatigue</b>.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors:</b>
            <br> Characteristics associated with an increased risk of PSF include <b>younger age, female sex, history of
                depression, and infratentorial stroke type</b>.

            <br><br><b>Impact:</b>
            <br> There is insufficient data linking PSF with mortality.

            <br><br><b>Assessment and Research Barriers:</b>
            <br> Various tools are used to evaluate PSF, with the <b>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) being the most widely
                used</b>.
            <br> A lack of consensus guidelines for assessment, including timing, are recognized barriers to studying
            and understanding PSF.

            <br><br><b>Treatment:</b>
            <br> Treatment is typically <b>multimodal</b>, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological
            interventions.
            <br> <b>Non-pharmacological interventions</b> focus on encouraging physical activity, addressing confounding
            factors like depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, and patient/caregiver education.
            <br> Small clinical trials suggest benefits from <b>transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)</b>,
            which can sustainably improve fatigue.
            <br> <b>Cognitive behavioral therapy</b> significantly reduced fatigue symptoms in a small trial.
            <br> Artificial sunlight spectrum lighting also reduced PSF in a small trial.
            <br> Evidence for <b>pharmacological interventions is limited</b>, with Modafinil (a central nervous system
            stimulant) showing improvement in fatigue symptoms in a small trial.
        </p>

        <h2>### Post-stroke Tremor (PST)</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Prevalence and Characteristics:</b>
            <br> Post-stroke movement disorders are rare, occurring in less than 4% of all stroke patients.
            <br> Tremors are present in <b>14% of stroke patients who develop a movement disorder</b> and are nearly
            twice as common in patients with hemorrhagic strokes as in ischemic strokes.
            <br> There is a <b>latency of several weeks to months</b> before the appearance of a tremor following a
            stroke.
            <br> PST can have a wide range of clinical presentations, from resting to postural tremors.
            <br> <b>Holmes tremor</b>, a specific type characterized by a combination of rest, action, and postural
            tremors, may result from acute stroke lesions in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop and the inferior
            olivary nucleus. Holmes tremor may occur simultaneously with dystonic posturing.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors and Impact:</b>
            <br> Risk factors for PST have <b>not been systematically analyzed</b>.
            <br> The association between PST and mortality is <b>not known</b>.

            <br><br><b>Treatment:</b>
            <br> <b>Levodopa</b> may alleviate tremor associated with dystonia.
            <br> <b>Deep brain stimulation (DBS)</b> has been used to treat refractory post-stroke maladaptive responses
            such as tremors, with case reports and series suggesting improvement similar to other causes of tremors.
            <br> <b>Dry Needling</b> may improve post-stroke tremor, supported by its mechanism of action and a few case
            reports.

            <br><br><b>Future Directions:</b>
            <br> Multicenter PST registries are needed.
            <br> Further evaluation of the role of Dry Needling for treating PST is needed.

        </p>
        <h2>### Post-stroke Dysphagia (PSDy)</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Definition and Prevalence:</b>
            <br> PSDy is defined as <b>any swallowing difficulty occurring after stroke</b>.
            <br> It affects <b>up to 80% of stroke survivors</b>, although reported prevalence varies due to differences
            in assessment methods.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors:</b>
            <br> Most risk factors are related to the <b>severity and localization of stroke lesions</b>, with higher
            risk in patients with severe stroke, large infarct size, subcortical versus cortical strokes, or brain stem
            involvement.
            <br> Other independent factors include <b>old age, low body mass index, and the presence of focal or global
                neurologic symptoms</b> such as dysarthria, dysphonia, and cognitive impairment.

            <br><br><b>Impact:</b>
            <br> PSDy is associated with an <b>increased risk of pneumonia (by a factor of 4) and death (a fourfold
                increased risk)</b> among stroke survivors.

            <br><br><b>Diagnostic Tools:</b>
            <br> Evaluation can include bedside physician screening or assessment of oral-pharyngeal-lingual mechanics
            by a speech-language pathologist.
            <br> <b>Video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) is the gold standard</b> for diagnosis. Deep Learning
            Analysis can aid in VFSS interpretation by automatically detecting penetration or aspiration.
            <br> <b>Fibre-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)</b> is another tool, offering the advantage of
            avoiding radiation exposure and ease of repetition at the bedside regardless of patient consciousness or
            cooperation.

            <br><br><b>Treatment Approaches:</b>
            <br> <b>Neurostimulation</b> techniques (peripheral and central) show potential:
            <br> - <b>Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES)</b> uses transnasal catheters, but replication of
            initial positive results has been limited.
            <br> - <b>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)</b> improved swallowing function when combined
            with traditional swallowing rehabilitation therapy, but not in isolation.
            <br> - <b>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)</b> applied to affected or
            contralateral hemispheres or cerebellum, combined with rehabilitation, improved dysphagia compared to sham
            treatment in meta-analyses. High frequency rTMS may be more effective. Bilateral rTMS combined with NMES
            showed better recovery than either alone.
            <br> - <b>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</b> improved swallowing function recovery,
            with suggestions of greater benefit from low intensity stimulation.
            <br> <b>Biofeedback</b>, particularly surface Electromyogram-biofeedback rehabilitation, improved swallowing
            function in a small trial.
            <br> <b>Acupuncture</b> is gaining interest, but its role needs further proof due to low quality of evidence
            in reviews. Electrical acupuncture may be superior to standard rehabilitation.
            <br> <b>Modified chin tuck against resistance exercise (mCTAR)</b> was superior to standard rehabilitation
            in a trial, particularly adapted for patients with disabilities.
            <br> <b>Resistive Jaw Opening Exercise (RJOE)</b> improved swallowing function in a clinical trial.
            <br> <b>Capsaicin with or without ice stimulation</b> could improve swallowing, as suggested by small
            trials.

            <br><br><b>Future Directions:</b>
            <br> There is a need to develop and validate predictive models to accurately distinguish patients who will
            develop chronic PSDy.
            <br> Larger trials are needed to confirm the role of capsaicin and ice stimulation for PSDy treatment.

        </p>
        <h2>### Post-stroke Pain (PSP)</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br><b>Prevalence and Characteristics:</b>
            <br> PSP affects <b>up to 80% of stroke survivors</b>.
            <br> It is often <b>unrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated</b> due to frequent cognitive and
            communication impairments following a stroke.
            <br> PSP includes central post-stroke pain, complex regional pain syndrome, shoulder pain, spasticity pain,
            and headache.
            <br> The onset of symptoms can range from immediate to years following a stroke.

            <br><br><b>Risk Factors and Impact:</b>
            <br> Data on the risks of PSP are <b>limited</b>.
            <br> PSP can <b>impair stroke recovery and quality of life</b>.

            <br><br><b>Diagnosis:</b>
            <br> Diagnosis relies largely on <b>clinical assessment</b>, including a thorough history of present
            symptoms and physical exam.
            <br> Supportive diagnostic tools are primarily used for classification and pathophysiological assessment,
            and may include three-phase bone scans, infrared thermal imaging, electromyogram, X-ray, computerized
            tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected body part.
            <br> There have been <b>few to no updates on diagnosing PSP</b>, possibly due to a lack of
            pathophysiological understanding of the disease processes.

            <br><br><b>Treatment Approaches:</b>
            <br> Treatment options are tailored to each PSP subtype and include both non-pharmacological and
            pharmacological interventions.
            <br> <b>Non-pharmacological options:</b>
            <br> - <b>General/Peripheral:</b> Kinesio tape, rehabilitative techniques, functional electrical
            stimulation, peripheral nerve blockade, Botulinum toxin A injection.
            <br> - <b>Central PSP:</b> Physiotherapy, electrical brain stimulation, acupuncture, and repetitive
            transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
            <br> - <b>Spasticity pain and hemiplegic shoulder pain:</b> Dry needling.
            <br> - <b>Headaches:</b> Cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and exercise.
            <br> <b>Pharmacological options:</b>
            <br> - Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antiseizure
            medications (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin, lamotrigine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs),
            steroids, muscle relaxants, topical analgesics, baclofen, dantrolene, tizanidine, clonidine, and antiemetic
            agents.
            <br> - <b>Opioids are generally ineffective</b> for post-stroke pain.

            <br> Post-stroke movement disorders can arise from <b>lesions affecting any part of the motor circuitry</b>,
            including cortical areas (primary motor, supplementary motor, premotor), subcortical structures (basal
            ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, diencephalon, mesencephalon), or cerebellar circuitry.
            <br> The <b>basal ganglia</b> are the central subcortical component, relaying information between the cortex
            and thalamus.
            <br> <b>Subcortical strokes are more likely to cause abnormal movements than cortical strokes</b>.
            <br> Damage to the <b>direct basal ganglia pathway</b> is linked to <b>hypokinetic</b> movements, while
            involvement of the <b>indirect pathway</b> leads to <b>hyperkinetic</b> movement disorders.
            <br> Some movements appear acutely, while others are delayed or progressive. Often, abnormal movements
            develop <b>after initial motor weakness improves</b>, resulting in delayed presentation.
            <br> This delayed onset highlights <b>neuronal plasticity</b>, where a pathological circuit forms as a
            parallel network to overcome motor loss, leading to abnormal movements.
            <br> Differences in brain metabolism and stroke susceptibility at various ages may explain why the type of
            movement disorder varies between adults and children.
            <br> While abnormal movements are usually <b>contralateral</b> to the stroke site, ipsilateral cases have
            been reported, possibly due to compensatory increased function in structures contralateral to the stroke.
            <br> There's no definitive link between the type of abnormal movement and the exact stroke site, as similar
            movements can result from lesions in different areas. Poor imaging resolution and <b>functional
                diaschisis</b> might play a role in this observation.
            <br> The incidence of movement disorders is <b>three times higher with subcortical strokes</b>, with the
            basal ganglia (44%) and thalamus (33%) being most frequently involved.
            <br> Post-stroke movement disorders are rarely seen with isolated cerebellar lesions.
        </p>

        <h2>Clinical Studies: Demographics and Types of Movement Disorders</h2>
        <p>
            <br> Post-stroke movement disorders tend to have a <b>higher prevalence in the elderly</b>, reflecting
            stroke's higher incidence in this age group.
            <br> - Mean age of presentation ranged from 53.5 to 70 years in various studies.
            <br> A slightly <b>higher prevalence in males</b> has been reported.
            <br> Movement disorders also occur in <b>children</b>.
            <br> The overall prevalence of post-stroke movement disorders ranges from <b>1–4%</b>.
            <br> Initial studies suggested a higher prevalence with <b>hemorrhagic stroke</b>, but later systematic
            reviews indicated that <b>two-thirds of cases were secondary to ischemic stroke</b>.
            <br> <b>Hemichorea</b> was identified as the most common movement disorder, followed by <b>dystonia</b>, in
            the Lausanne registry and Alarcon studies.
            <br> In a systematic review of post-thalamic stroke movement disorders, <b>dystonia</b> (102 cases) was the
            most common, followed by hemiataxia (72) and chorea (70).
            <br> - <b>Hemiataxia</b> was the most common acute movement disorder following thalamic stroke.
            <br> Another systematic review found <b>dystonia (n=66) as the most common overall</b>, followed by chorea
            (n=46) and myoclonus (n=43).
            <br> - <b>Dystonia was commoner in younger patients</b> (>50 years), while <b>chorea was more
                prominent in the elderly</b>.
            <br> Other reported movement disorders include tremor, parkinsonism, restless legs syndrome, alien hand
            syndrome, periodic limb movements, stereotypy, akathisia, and tics.
        </p>

        <h2>Hemichorea-Hemiballism</h2>
        <p>
            <br> <b>Hemichorea</b> involves unilateral, rapid, involuntary movements of flexion, extension, rotation, or
            crossing, predominantly affecting distal body parts.
            <br> <b>Hemiballism</b> is a severe, violent, arrhythmic, large-amplitude excursion of a limb from a
            proximal joint with a rotational element.
            <br> It is the <b>commonest post-stroke movement disorder</b>.
            <br> - In a study of 2500 patients, 38% of post-stroke abnormal movements were hemichorea-hemiballism.
            <br> Traditionally linked to contralateral STN lesions, it can also occur with lesions in other brain parts.
            <br> - <b>Thalamic or lentiform nucleus lesions</b> are more frequently associated with hemiballism
            than subthalamic lesions.
            <br> - Hemichorea is commonly seen with lesions of the <b>lentiform nucleus or thalamus</b>, but also
            reported with lesions in the subthalamus, striatum, internal capsule, corona radiata, frontal, parietal,
            temporal cortex, external capsule, and pons.
            <br> Typically contralateral to the lesion, but rare ipsilateral cases have been reported.
            <br> Hemiballism often occurs immediately after stroke, while hemichorea appears within a few days.
            <br> Can be caused by small vessel disease, vascular malformations (cavernous malformation, moyamoya
            disease), and carotid stenosis.
            <br> Though once believed to have a grave prognosis, more recent studies show a <b>more benign course with
                spontaneous recovery</b>.
            <br> Pharmacological treatment is often necessary due to the serious nature of the movements.
            <br> - <b>Antidopaminergic therapy</b>: Typical neuroleptics (haloperidol, pimozide, perphenazine,
            fluphenazine) and atypical neuroleptics (olanzapine, quetiapine, sulpiride).
            <br> - <b>Catecholamine-depleting agents</b>: Tetrabenazine, reserpine.
            <br> - <b>GABAergic drugs</b>: Clonazepam, sodium valproate.
            <br> - Other effective drugs: Levetiracetam, topiramate.
            <br> Surgical intervention (stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy, chronic thalamic stimulation) can
            be effective in refractory cases.
            <br> Intravenous thrombolysis has shown success in acute cases.

        </p>
        <h2>Dystonia</h2>
        <p>
            <br> Defined as a movement disorder characterized by <b>sustained or intermittent muscle contractions</b>
            causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements or postures, typically patterned and twisting, and sometimes
            tremulous.
            <br> Dystonic movements are often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow
            muscle activation.
            <br> It is the <b>second most common movement disorder after stroke</b> (around 20% of cases).
            <br> In children with basal ganglia stroke, 21% developed dystonia, more frequently in younger children and
            girls, with onset typically 6–12 months post-stroke.
            <br> Can be slow, rapid, or jerk-like.
            <br> Manifests as segmental, focal, or hemidystonia (involving ipsilateral face, arm, and leg).
            <br> Often <b>unilateral and contralateral to the lesion</b>, but can be bilateral or generalized;
            ipsilateral dystonia is rare.
            <br> <b>Focal hand dystonia</b> is the most common presentation.
            <br> Can be associated with tremor, myoclonus, or athetosis.
            <br> Vascular dystonia is the most common cause of secondary movement disorders, accounting for nearly 50%
            of cases.
            <br> Lesions are most frequently found in the <b>lentiform nucleus (especially putamen), caudate, pallidum,
                thalamus</b>, and midbrain.
            <br> Dystonia also occurs after vascular lesions at the brainstem-diencephalic junction, leading to cranial
            dystonia like blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia.
            <br> Significant disability can result if untreated.
            <br> <b>Botulinum toxin</b> is a mainstay of therapy.
            <br> Medical treatments include:
            <br> - Benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam).
            <br> - Baclofen.
            <br> - Anticholinergic drugs (trihexyphenidyl).
            <br> - Dopamine-depleting/blocking agents (tetrabenazine).
            <br> - Gabapentin.
            <br> Surgical interventions like <b>thalamotomy, pallidotomy, and deep brain stimulation (DBS)</b> are
            beneficial, with DBS of the thalamus or GPi showing long-lasting responses.
        </p>

        <h2>Tremor</h2>
        <p>
            <br> A rhythmic, oscillatory movement from alternating or synchronous contractions of antagonist muscles,
            occurring at rest or during action.
            <br> Usually a <b>delayed presentation</b>, but can be acute.
            <br> Post-stroke tremor is mainly an <b>action tremor</b> (postural or kinetic), though combinations with
            rest tremor are seen.
            <br> Can be focal, multifocal, segmental, or generalized, but often multifocal/segmental and unilateral.
            <br> Frequently coexists with other abnormal movement disorders.
            <br> Lesions in the <b>posterior thalamus</b> or affecting <b>dentatorubrothalamic, cerebellothalamic, or
                nigrostriatal pathways</b> can cause post-stroke tremors.
            <br> - Cerebellothalamic loops: kinetic or postural tremors.
            <br> - Nigrostriatal pathways: rest tremors.
            <br> - Substantia nigra or pontomesencephalic infarct: acute Parkinsonian or head tremor.
            <br> - Brainstem syndromes (Claude's, Benedikt): contralateral tremors.
            <br> - Thalamic strokes involving posterior circulation: slow (1–3 Hz) rest and postural tremors
            (myorhythmia).
            <br> - Palatal myoclonus (a slow rhythmical movement): linked to lesions in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle.
            <br> <b>Often refractory to pharmacotherapy</b>.
            <br> Treatments include:
            <br> - Clonazepam and sodium valproate for rubral and palatal tremor or myoclonic tremor.
            <br> - Topiramate.
            <br> - Levodopa for Holmes’ tremor (due to dopaminergic system involvement).
            <br> - Non-pharmacological: adding weights to limbs, using larger utensils.
            <br> - <b>Deep brain stimulation (DBS)</b> targeting thalamic nuclei (ventralis intermedius,
            ventralis oralis posterior) or lenticular fasciculus can be useful in severe cases.

        </p>
        <h2>Myoclonus</h2>
        <p>
            <br> Sudden, involuntary, brief, jerk-like, irregular contractions of muscle groups.
            <br> Typically associated with <b>lesions in the thalamus, midbrain, and pons</b>.
            <br> Can be focal or segmental.
            <br> May be observed with focal neurological signs and superimposed asterixis with dystonic posturing in
            thalamic lesions.
            <br> Generalized post-stroke myoclonus has been reported following STN infarct.
            <br> Treatments include:
            <br> - <b>Clonazepam and sodium valproate</b> (most cases).
            <br> - Levetiracetam, piracetam, primidone, tetrabenazine, acetazolamide, and botulinum toxin injections.
        </p>
        <h2>Asterixis</h2>
        <p>
            <br> A type of negative myoclonus caused by the sudden cessation of electrical activity, leading to sustained
            contraction in extensor muscles.
            <br> Proposed mechanism involves intermittent inhibition of the spinal neuronal system and loss of sustained
            muscle contraction due to lesions in the <b>medial frontal cortex, parietal lobe, ventrolateral thalamus</b>, or
            their supratentorial influence over brainstem-spinal cord connections.
            <br> Occurs mainly during the <b>acute phase of stroke</b>.
            <br> Associated with lesions in the <b>thalamus, basal ganglia, frontoparietal cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, and
                pons</b>.
            <br> Usually unilateral, primarily affecting the upper limbs, but bilateral and lower limb cases have been
            reported.
            <br> The incidence was found to be 0.08% in the Lausanne stroke registry and 1.9% in the Kim et al. series.
            <br> <b>Typically self-limiting and often does not require treatment</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Vascular Parkinsonism (VP)</h2>
        <p>
            <br> First described in 1929.
            <br> Comprises <b>2.5–5% of all parkinsonism cases</b>.
            <br> Also known as arteriosclerotic parkinsonism, vascular pseudoparkinsonism, and lower body parkinsonism.
            <br> Two forms:
            <br> - <b>Acute form</b>: seen immediately with basal ganglia and thalamic infarction.
            <br> - <b>Chronic form</b>: diffuse white matter degeneration in the lentiform nucleus and striatum.
            <br> <b>Clinical features</b>:
            <br> - 90% present with gait abnormality.
            <br> - More gait problems, postural instability, predominant lower-body involvement, pseudobulbar affect,
            corticospinal signs, urinary incontinence, and dementia compared to Parkinson's Disease (PD).
            <br> - <b>Less responsive to levodopa</b> (around 22-30% respond).
            <br> - Olfactory function is typically normal.
            <br> - Age at onset is generally higher than in PD.
            <br> <b>Brain imaging</b> commonly shows lacunar infarcts, white matter changes in subcortical white matter,
            basal ganglia, thalamus, frontal lobes, and upper brainstem.
            <br> <b>Dopamine transporter (DAT) scan</b> usually shows normal dopamine content in the striatum,
            distinguishing it from idiopathic PD, though asymmetric DAT deficits can occur in VP.
            <br> <b>Treatment</b>:
            <br> - Levodopa response is limited (30% meta-analysis). Patients with substantia nigra lesions are 15 times
            more likely to respond. Those with DAT deficiency on SPECT also respond better.
            <br> - Other therapies like vitamin D supplementation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and lumbar puncture
            have not been promising.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Stereotypies</h2>
        <p>
            <br> Involuntary, coordinated, repetitive, patterned, rhythmic, and seemingly purposeless movements.
            <br> Few stroke-induced cases reported, some as acute presentations.
            <br> Associated with lesions in the <b>parietal, lenticulostriatal, thalamic, midbrain</b>, or left middle
            cerebral artery territory.
            <br> Most patients had unilateral lesions, though bilateral basal ganglia lesions have also been linked.
            <br> Can be mimicked by clonic perseveration.
            <br> <b>Treatment is challenging</b>: Tetrabenazine has not been evaluated, and stereotypy is usually
            refractory to benzodiazepines, amantadine, and anticholinergics.
        </p>

        <h2>Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD)</h2>
        <p>
            <br> <b>Very rare</b> post-stroke conditions, with a prevalence of 12.4%.
            <br> More common in women.
            <br> Associated with lesions in the <b>pons (tegmentum), corona radiata, basal ganglia, thalamus,
                cerebellum, cortex, and internal capsule</b>.
            <br> Post-stroke RLS is predominantly bilateral, while PLMD can be ipsilateral, bilateral, or contralateral.
            <br> Presentation is acute, typically within 1–4 days for RLS and 1–30 days for PLMD.
            <br> Proposed mechanism involves disinhibition of supraspinal control over reticulospinal and corticospinal
            tracts, involvement of the sensory system (medial lemniscus), and the role of basal ganglia in bilateral
            symptoms.
            <br> Post-stroke RLS often persists, while PLMD is transient.
            <br> Treatments include levodopa, clonazepam, dopamine agonists, gabapentin, and pregabalin.
        </p>

        <h2>Transient Limb Shaking TIA</h2>
        <p>
            <br> First described as trembling, shaking, twisting, drawing up, or irregular movement of any limb.
            <br> Abnormal involuntary movements secondary to <b>carotid artery stenosis</b>.
            <br> Caused by ischemia of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere.
            <br> Precipitated by postural changes that lower blood pressure.
            <br> Often mistaken for focal motor seizures but distinguished by lack of Jacksonian march and
            non-involvement of the face.
            <br> EEG is normal, and no response to anticonvulsants.
            <br> Considered a <b>heralding sign for disabling stroke</b>, emphasizing the importance of identification.
            <br> Carotid artery stenting can lower future stroke risk.
        </p>

        <h2>Post-stroke Tics</h2>
        <p>
            <br> Prevalence reported as 1.2% in a series of secondary tics and tourettism.
            <br> Cases of secondary tourettism reported following <b>subcortical stroke involving the basal ganglia and
                superior cerebellar peduncle</b>.
            <br> Can manifest as cranial-lingual-cervical tics, coprolalia, or suppressible arm shaking.
            <br> Can coexist with attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dystonia, and
            hemiballism.
