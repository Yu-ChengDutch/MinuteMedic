        <h1>#### Disease/Disorder</h1>

        <p>
            <br><br><b>Definition</b>: Cerebrovascular disease refers to an abnormality of the brain resulting from a
            pathological process of the blood vessels. <b>Stroke</b>, or cerebrovascular accident, is defined as the
            abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit caused by cerebrovascular disease.
            <br><br><b>Etiology</b>:
            <br><b>Ischemic strokes</b> account for 88% of all strokes. Their subtypes and underlying mechanisms are
            based on the TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification system, which includes five
            subtypes:
            <br> - <b>Large-artery atherosclerosis</b>: Involves stenosis or occlusion of major brain or cortical
            arteries.
            <br> - <b>Cardioembolism</b>: Occurs when an embolus originates from the heart.
            <br> - <b>Small-artery occlusion</b>: Also known as lacunar stroke or small vessel disease.
            <br> - <b>Stroke of other determined etiology</b>: Includes nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies,
            hypercoagulable states, or hematologic disorders.
            <br> - <b>Stroke of undetermined etiology</b>: When the cause cannot be confidently determined.
            <br><b>Hemorrhagic strokes</b> make up 13% of all strokes. They are subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage
            (within the brain) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (between the inner and outer layers of tissue covering the
            brain).
            <br> - <b>Most often caused by hypertension</b>, with typical lesion locations including the basal ganglia
            (50%), cerebral lobes (10-20%), thalamus (15%), and pons and brainstem (10-20%).
            <br> - <b>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)</b> is another significant cause of primary lobar intracerebral
            bleeding in older adults, characterized by amyloid-B peptide deposition in cerebral vasculature.
            <br> - Other risk factors include dual antiplatelet therapy, chronic liver disease, sympathomimetics, old
            age, male sex, and tumors.
            <br><br><b>Epidemiology including risk factors and primary prevention</b>:
            <br>Stroke is the <b>leading cause of long-term adult disability</b> and the fifth leading cause of death in
            the United States. Although mortality decreased in the past two decades, research suggests it may be rising
            again.
            <br>Risk factors are broadly categorized as modifiable and non-modifiable.
            <br><b>Modifiable risk factors</b> (which can be reduced with treatment) include:
            <br> - <b>Hypertension</b>: The number one risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Blood
            pressure categories define "high blood pressure" as Hypertension stage 1 (SBP 130-139 or DP 80-89),
            Hypertension stage 2 (SBP ≥ 140 or DP ≥ 90), and Hypertensive crisis (SBP > 180 and/or DP > 120). For adults
            18-79, the primary SBP/DP goal is less than 140/90 mmHg, with a target of less than 130/80 mmHg (but not
            <120 /70 mmHg) if tolerated. For adults>80, the target is less than 140/90 mmHg. Lifestyle modifications are
                recommended for elevated hypertension.
                <br> - <b>Current smoking status</b>.
                <br> - <b>Waist-to-hip ratio</b>.
                <br> - <b>Diet</b>.
                <br> - <b>Physical inactivity</b>.
                <br> - <b>Hyperlipidemia</b>: Elevated total cholesterol increases ischemic stroke risk, while increased
                HDL decreases it. Increased LDL is associated with increased large artery ischemic stroke risk, and
                increased HDL with lower small vessel ischemic stroke risk.
                <br> - <b>Diabetes mellitus</b>: A stand-alone risk factor, with duration of diabetes markedly
                increasing ischemic stroke likelihood and accounting for about 20% of deaths in patients with the
                disease. Intensive insulin treatment (target BG 80-130 mg/dL) did not affect 90-day functional outcomes
                in acute ischemic stroke compared to standard treatment (target BG 80-179 mg/dL).
                <br> - <b>Alcohol consumption</b>.
                <br> - <b>Cardiac causes</b>, including <b>nonvalvular atrial fibrillation</b>, which increases ischemic
                stroke risk by 4 to 5-fold due to embolism of stasis-induced thrombi.
                <br> - <b>Apolipoprotein B to A1</b>.
                <br> - <b>Obesity</b>: Associated with increased incidence of all listed modifiable risk factors.
                <br> - <b>Tobacco use and other substance abuse</b>.
                <br><b>Non-modifiable risk factors</b> identified by the INTERSTROKE study include age, sex, and
                race/ethnicity. Other non-modifiable factors include a family history of cerebrovascular disease, sickle
                cell disease, or hypercoagulable states. Ethnic populations like African Americans and Hispanics are
                more likely to have cerebrovascular disease.
                <br><br><b>Patho-anatomy/physiology</b>: Signs and symptoms are characteristic of vascular lesions in
                various arterial territories of the brain:
                <br><b>Middle cerebral</b>: Contralateral loss of strength and sensation in face, upper limb, and to a
                lesser extent, lower limb. Aphasia (dominant hemisphere) or neglect (nondominant hemisphere).
                <br><b>Anterior cerebral</b>: Contralateral loss of strength and sensation in the lower limb (hand and
                face usually spared).
                <br><b>Posterior cerebral</b>: Homonymous hemianopsia, possible confusion and aphasia if in the dominant
                hemisphere.
                <br><b>Penetrating branches (lacunar syndrome)</b>: Contralateral weakness or sensory loss (usually not
                both) in face, arm, and leg. Dysarthria or ataxia may be present. Aphasia, neglect, or visual loss are
                not characteristic.
                <br><b>Basilar</b>: Combinations of limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, facial and limb weakness, and
                sensory loss. Pupillary asymmetry, dysconjugate gaze, decreased responsiveness, and visual field loss
                may be present.
                <br><b>Vertebral (or posterior inferior cerebellar)</b>: Truncal ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia,
                ipsilateral sensory loss on the face, and contralateral sensory loss below the neck.
                <br><br><b>Disease progression including natural history, disease phases or stages, disease trajectory
                    (clinical features and presentation over time)</b>:
                <br><b>Thrombotic/atherosclerotic strokes</b> typically have a slow, fluctuating clinical course, with
                deficits progressing over 24 to 48 hours, and are more likely preceded by transient ischemic attacks.
                Large thrombotic strokes carry an increased risk of cerebral edema and herniation.
                <br><b>Cardioembolic strokes</b> have a sudden onset, and while neurologic deficits can be severe, they
                may rapidly resolve as the embolus fragments.
                <br><b>Hypertensive hemorrhages</b> present with headache, rapid deterioration (in large lesions),
                nausea, or vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure.
                <br><br><b>Specific secondary or associated conditions and complications</b>: Medical complications
                occur in 40%-96% of cases and are related to poor outcomes. The most common neurologic complication is
                recurrent stroke. Other complications include epileptic seizure, urinary tract infection, chest
                infection, pressure sores, falls, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, shoulder pain, depression,
                anxiety, and confusion.

        <h1>#### Essentials of Assessment</h1>

        <p>
            <br><br><b>History</b>:
            <br>Initial evaluation for acute ischemic stroke may involve IV tPA (tissue plasminogen activator)
            administration within 3 hours (or 4.5 hours for a selective subgroup) of last known normal.
            <br>Mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever is recommended for eligible patients 18 years or older with
            specific criteria (minimal pre-stroke disability, causative occlusion of internal carotid artery or proximal
            middle cerebral artery, NIHSS ≥ 6, reassuring non-contrast CT head (ASPECT score ≥ 6), and treatment within
            6 hours).
            <br>Upon admission to a rehabilitation unit, stroke distribution, type, etiology, acute interventions,
            hospital course, and complications should be documented.
            <br>Medical history should focus on stroke risk factors.
            <br>A thorough social history should cover family support, home environment, and substance use.
            <br><br><b>Physical examination</b>:
            <br><b>Vital signs</b> should focus on temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and blood
            pressure for the previous 24 hours. Level of arousal and responsiveness should always be documented.
            <br><b>Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT)</b> examination includes incision sites, extraocular
            musculature, pupils, and nasogastric tube presence.
            <br><b>Cardiovascular</b> examination involves auscultation for murmurs, distant heart sounds, irregular
            rhythm, and carotid bruits.
            <br><b>Pulmonary</b> examination requires careful auscultation.
            <br><b>Abdominal</b> examination documents bowel sounds, tenderness, and presence of PEG tube or urinary
            catheter.
            <br>A <b>careful neurologic examination</b> can localize brain dysfunction, evaluating mental status,
            cranial nerves, motor, cerebellar, and sensory function, motor control, strength, balance, coordination,
            gait, cortical function (aphasia, apraxia, neglect, cortical sensation), and spasticity.
            <br><b>Extremity</b> examination should check for distal pulses, edema, color changes, and calf pain.
            <br><br><b>Functional assessment</b>:
            <br>Documents prestroke baseline and current status to aid prognosis. This includes prestroke ability to
            perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs), ambulatory status, and durable medical equipment use.
            <br>Physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments are valuable for poststroke functional status.
            <br>Premorbid cognitive impairments (psychiatric disease, dementia, learning disability) should be
            documented.
            <br>Speech/language pathologists provide input for cognitive and communication deficits.
            <br>A <b>swallow assessment</b> may include a bedside evaluation, modified barium swallow, or fiberoptic
            endoscopic evaluation of swallow (FEES) to assess dysphagia and aspiration risk.
            <br>Caregiver services required prior to admission should be documented.
            <br><br><b>Laboratory studies</b>:
            <br>Focus on identifying stroke etiology and evaluating for acute treatments.
            <br>Standard practice includes serum electrolytes, cholesterol panel, liver function tests, complete blood
            count, and hemoglobin A1c.
            <br>If coagulopathy is suspected, a coagulation panel, D-dimer, and fibrinogen are performed.
            <br><b>Hypercoagulable testing</b> for arterial thromboses includes antiphospholipid antibody panel, lupus
            anticoagulant, Russell viper venom, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. For venous thromboses, tests include
            protein C and S, antithrombin III, Factor V Leiden, and Factor II G20210A.
            <br><b>Autoimmune testing</b> may include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, Complement
            components 3 and 4, SS-A, SS-B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.
            <br>For hereditary stroke concerns, testing for mutations of the Notch 3 gene can help diagnose Cerebral
            Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
            <br><br><b>Imaging</b>:
            <br><b>Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT)</b>: Aids in ruling out hemorrhagic stroke (blood is
            hyperintense/bright), while acute ischemic strokes appear hypointense/dark within 24 hours. Signs of
            ischemic stroke on CT include loss of grey/white differentiation, sulcal effacement, slit-like ventricles,
            and midline shift. Administration of tPA can often be implemented based on NCCT findings alone.
            <br><b>CT perfusion (CTP) scans</b>: Used to determine salvageable tissue after reperfusion therapy, but AHA
            guidelines do not suggest its use in the early time window (less than 6 hours). It is reasonable if NCCT +/-
            CTAngio are insufficient.
            <br><b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</b>: More sensitive for identifying acute ischemic lesions within
            minutes of occlusion. Sequences include T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, and ADC. In acute ischemic stroke, acute lesions
            are hyperintense on DWI and hypointense on ADC.
            <br><br><b>Supplemental assessment tools</b>:
            <br><b>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)</b>: Evaluates intracranial and extracranial vessels for
            stenosis, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations.
            <br><b>Magnetic resonance venography</b>: Identifies venous sinus thrombosis and atypical hemorrhagic
            infarcts.
            <br><b>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound</b>: Rapid technique to determine flow velocity through basilar
            arteries, aiding diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, vasospasm, SAH, sickle cell disease, and brain death.
            <br><br><b>Early predictions of outcomes</b>:
            <br>Females often have greater disability and worse functional recovery than males after stroke.
            <br>Racial differences exist: African Americans are often younger, have more hemorrhagic strokes, and are
            more disabled on admission than non-Hispanic Whites, showing less functional status improvement per day in
            inpatient rehabilitation after adjustment.
            <br><b>Additional risk factors for disability</b> after stroke include:
            <br> - Severe stroke with minimal motor recovery at 4 weeks (prolonged flaccidity or late return of
            proprioceptive facilitation of proximal traction response in the arm).
            <br> - Bilateral lesions.
            <br> - Low level of consciousness.
            <br> - Previous stroke or functional disability.
            <br> - Poor sitting balance.
            <br> - Severe neglect, sensory and visual deficits.
            <br> - Global aphasia.
            <br> - Urinary or fecal incontinence (lasting >1-2 weeks).
            <br> - Delay in medical care.
            <br><br><b>Environmental</b>:
            <br>Turning/positioning schedules are crucial to prevent stage I pressure ulcers, which can form in as
            little as 2 hours in patients with limited bed mobility.
            <br>Orientation cues like daily updated dry-erase boards are important for patients with confusion or
            neglect.
            <br><br><b>Social role and social support system</b>:
            <br>Changes to the patient's social role are common, leading to a sense of loss and grief. Family and
            friends' support is extremely important during this time.
            <br><br><b>Professional issues</b>:
            <br>The goal of acute stroke treatment and rehabilitation is to <b>restore as much independence as
                possible</b> by improving physical, mental, and emotional function, while preserving dignity and
            motivating the patient.

            <br>Studies show CIMT induces use-dependent cortical reorganization and significant improvements in motor
            and functional outcomes, though results are mixed.
            <br>Effective in patients with active wrist/finger extension, good cognition, limited spasticity, and
            preserved balance.
            <br><b>High volume CIMT combined with electrical stimulation, task-specific training, and strength
                training</b> is most effective for upper limb motor function.
            <br><br><b>Bilateral upper extremity training</b>:
            <br>Applied in both acute and chronic post-stroke phases.
            <br>Recommended for <b>chronic phase patients with little or no distal movement</b> who may benefit more
            than those with retained corticospinal integrity.
            <br>Aims to target the contralesional hemisphere in patients without corticospinal tract integrity, though
            functional gains may be small.
            <br><br><b>Body-weight-supported (BWS) therapy</b>:
            <br>Allows safe task-specific gait training using a harness that supports body weight over a treadmill or
            surface.
            <br>Improves ambulation in hemiparetic stroke patients, producing a more symmetric and efficient gait.
            <br><b>Superiority over conventional gait training has not been established</b>.
            <br><br><b>Robotics</b>:
            <br>Ideal for <b>repetitive exercises</b> to facilitate motor relearning and strengthening in both upper and
            lower limb rehabilitation.
            <br>Newer software incorporates gaming to make tasks more engaging and can collect data for the
            rehabilitation team.
            <br>Barriers include limited supporting studies, high cost, and limited knowledge of the technology.
            <br><br><b>Brain-computer interface (BCI)</b>:
            <br>Evolved from assistive technologies to <b>neurorehabilitation tools</b>, allowing patients with severe
            motor deficits to participate in rehabilitation.
            <br>Involves developing neuroprosthetic devices that <b>bypass damaged brain tissue</b> by harnessing
            uninvolved distal brain areas for adaptive neuroplasticity.
            <br>Uses brain signals to drive external devices without peripheral physiological activity.
            <br>Barriers include high cost and unreliable technology.
            <br><br><b>Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) – Transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation</b>:
            <br>Applies mild magnetic or electric stimulation to the scalp, thought to neuromodulate plasticity and
            cortical excitability.
            <br>Studies support its therapeutic potential and safety, showing improvements in motor function, gait,
            language (aphasia), cognitive (neglect) deficits, and mood.
            <br>Results vary based on stimulation type, location, and protocol, warranting further research.
            <br><br><b>Mental Practice (MP)/Motor Imagery</b>:
            <br>Refers to <b>mental rehearsal of a movement</b>, stimulating overlapping cortical areas as actual
            movements.
            <br>Most studies show a positive effect on upper extremity function.
            <br><b>More effective when combined with routine rehabilitation</b> than rehabilitation alone.
            <br>MP/MI alone is not effective, but when used with conventional and non-conventional therapies, it helps
            in recovering upper limb motor movements, speed, and coordination. Further research is needed for assessment
            tools.
            <br><br><b>Mirror Therapy</b>:
            <br>Involves placing a mirror to reflect the non-paretic limb as if it were the paretic one, aiming for
            cortical activation of the injured brain region via interhemispheric communication.
            <br>Though some studies show motor function gains, <b>limited evidence exists for routine use in stroke
                patients</b>.
            <br><br><b>Virtual reality (VR)</b>:
            <br>Provides visual feedback and repetitive skills practice in virtual environments.
            <br>Evidence suggests VR and interactive video gaming may be beneficial for <b>improving upper limb function
                and ADL function as an adjunctive therapy</b> or when compared to standard therapy.
            <br>Insufficient evidence on grip strength, gait speed, or global motor function.
            <br>Combining VR with robotic exoskeletons has shown significant improvement in cognitive flexibility,
            attention, visual research, and quality of life.

        <h1>#### Rehabilitation Management and Treatments</h1>

        <p>
            <br><br><b>Current treatment guidelines</b>: The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke
            Association (ASA) publish guidelines for stroke management and rehabilitation.
            <br><br><b>Acute stroke management</b>:
            <br><b>Emergency noncontrast CT scan</b> is performed to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke.
            <br><b>Intravenous thrombolysis with rTPA</b> is indicated for eligible adults with acute ischemic stroke
            within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.
            <br><b>Endovascular techniques</b> (e.g., thrombectomy) are recommended for selected patients with large
            vessel occlusion within 16-24 hours. rTPA should still be administered if eligible. Intracranial vascular
            imaging (CT or MR angiogram) is recommended if endovascular therapy is considered.
            <br><b>Aspirin initiation within 24-48 hours</b> is indicated for ischemic strokes; clopidogrel is an
            alternative for aspirin-allergic patients.
            <br>For <b>intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)</b>, initial management includes reversal of coagulopathy and
            monitoring/lowering intracranial pressure. Surgical evacuation is generally not for supratentorial
            hemorrhage but is recommended for cerebellar ICH with brainstem compression or hydrocephalus.
            <br><b>Comprehensive stroke centers and stroke systems of care</b> improve outcomes.
            <br><br><b>Acute and post-acute stroke management and rehabilitation</b>:
            <br><b>Early initiation of rehabilitation</b> is associated with shorter rehabilitation lengths of stay and
            improved functional outcomes.
            <br>Goals include <b>preventing complications, minimizing functional impairments, and maximizing functional
                recovery</b>.
            <br>Rehabilitation starts in acute care and transitions to inpatient rehabilitation, then possibly to
            sub-acute inpatient, day programs, outpatient, or home therapy.
            <br>A <b>multidisciplinary team</b>, often led by a rehabilitation physician, is essential. Team members
            include:
            <br> - <b>Physical therapy</b>: Mobility, strengthening, balance, endurance, transfers, ambulation.
            <br> - <b>Occupational therapy</b>: Self-care, ADLs, upper extremity impairments.
            <br> - <b>Speech and language pathology</b>: Cognitive, language, and swallowing impairments.
            <br> - <b>Neuropsychology</b>: Psychological support, cognitive assessment and interventions.
            <br> - <b>Nursing</b>: Bed mobility, positioning, bowel/bladder, skin care, education.
            <br> - <b>Recreational therapy</b>: Community integration, functional cognitive tasks.
            <br> - <b>Social work/Case management</b>: Discharge planning, resources, guidance.
            <br> - <b>Other disciplines</b>: Vocational rehabilitation, dietician, pharmacist.
            <br><br><b>The rehabilitation physician and team play a significant role in minimizing complications</b>,
            including:
            <br><b>Early mobilization</b> to prevent deconditioning.
            <br><b>Evaluation and treatment of dysphagia</b>, including formal swallowing assessments (VFSS or FEES)
            before oral intake, due to high aspiration risk.
            <br>Ensuring <b>adequate nutrition</b> and hydration.
            <br>Monitoring and treating <b>blood glucose levels</b> (maintaining 140-180 mg/dl post-stroke).
            <br><b>Blood pressure management</b>: Controversy exists in the acute stage; generally reasonable to
            restart/initiate antihypertensives if >140/90 mmHg once neurologically stable, and lowering BP no more than
            15% in the first 24 hours if significantly elevated (≥220/120 mmHg).
            <br><b>Spasticity prevention and early detection</b> through mobilization, range of motion, positioning,
            braces, and medications (tizanidine, dantrolene, baclofen, botulinum toxin, intrathecal baclofen).
            Benzodiazepines should be avoided.
            <br><b>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis</b> via early mobilization, pharmacological prophylaxis
            (heparin, LMWH), pneumatic compression devices, or graduated compression stockings.
            <br><b>Shoulder pain prevention and treatment</b> (proper positioning, limb support, trauma prevention,
            medications, injections, therapy).
            <br><b>Bladder management</b> (timed voids, intermittent catheterization, avoiding indwelling catheters).
            <br><b>Bowel management</b> (diet, fluid, exercise, laxatives, stool softeners, bowel training).
            <br><b>Skin integrity assessment and prevention of breakdown</b> (special mattresses, frequent turning,
            positioning, protective dressings).
            <br><b>Medication considerations</b>: Avoiding CNS depressants (neuroleptics, benzodiazepines,
            barbiturates).
            <br><b>Post-stroke depression</b>: Affects up to 1/3 of patients; early diagnosis and treatment (SSRIs
            preferred) is recommended as it negatively affects outcomes and may increase recurrent stroke risk. Emerging
            treatments include ECT, acupuncture, music therapy, and nutraceuticals.
            <br><b>Fall risk assessment and prevention</b> (low beds, alarms, wheelchair belts, education).
            <br><b>Infection prevention and prompt treatment</b> (fever reduction, pneumonia, UTIs).
            <br><br><b>Specific rehabilitation interventions</b>: Based on comprehensive assessments of impairments and
            functional status:
            <br><b>Motor assessment and function</b>: Strength, ROM, tone, coordination, balance, apraxia, mobility
            addressed with various therapies like strengthening, gait training, orthoses, TENS, robot-assisted therapy,
            CIMT, BWS treadmill training, and functional electrical stimulation.
            <br><b>Sensory assessment and compensatory techniques</b>.
            <br><b>Cognitive assessment and management</b>: Arousal, attention, visual neglect, learning, memory,
            executive function, problem-solving, managed through education and compensatory strategies.
            <br><b>Psychosocial assessments</b>: Psychological factors, psychiatric illnesses, resources, social
            support, patient goals, home assessment.
            <br><b>Dysphagia management</b>: Postural changes, sensory input, swallowing maneuvers, exercises, diet
            modifications; non-oral feeding may be needed.
            <br><b>Aphasia and dysarthria management</b>: Early recognition, multidisciplinary treatment, compensatory
            techniques, AAC devices, and telerehabilitation.
            <br><b>Visual and spatial neglect measures</b>: Prism glasses, increased awareness, compensatory techniques.
            <br><b>Neuropsychiatric sequelae</b>: Identified and treated; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or Memantine
            for vascular dementia/cognitive impairment. Amphetamines are not recommended for motor recovery.
            <br><b>Patient, family, and caregiver education</b> is integral, along with advocacy and resource
            identification.
            <br><br><b>Chronic stroke management</b>:
            <br>Rehabilitation team provides support for <b>transitioning from inpatient to home</b>, including durable
            medical equipment, home programs, follow-up appointments, and support groups.
            <br>Ongoing management includes <b>regular exercise, walking aids, adaptive devices, home modifications</b>,
            addressing return to work/driving, sexual dysfunction, and ongoing management of stroke risk factors and
            comorbid conditions.
            <br><b>Secondary prevention of stroke</b> is crucial, involving appropriate treatment of hypertension,
            anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, antiplatelet therapy, prevention of coronary heart disease,
            lipid-lowering therapy, exercise, smoking cessation, and maintaining near-normoglycemic blood sugar levels
            (80-140 mg/dl).
            <br><br><b>Coordination of care</b>: Essential for success, involving all medical specialists, home care,
            outpatient therapists, and the patient/caregivers.
            <br><br><b>Patient & family education</b>: Focuses on risk factor management, maintaining rehabilitation
            gains, preventing complications, community support, resources, home modifications, and community
            reintegration.
            <br><b>Key topics for stroke prevention</b>: Modifiable risk factors (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes,
            obesity), smoking cessation, avoiding excess alcohol, balanced diet, exercise.
            <br><b>Key topics for post-stroke complication education and prevention</b>: Regular follow-up, monitoring
            for depression, spasticity/contractures, shoulder pain/subluxation, DVTs, pressure ulcers, pneumonias,
            seizures, osteoporosis, UTIs/bladder control.
            <br><b>Treatment/preventative techniques</b>: Counseling/psychotherapy for depression, ROM exercises for
            contractures/shoulder pain, good nutrition/pressure relief for ulcers, swallowing/deep breathing exercises
            for pneumonia, bladder training.
            <br><br><b>Outcome measures</b>: Important indicators include functional status, discharge disposition (home
            vs. facility), hospital readmissions, and mortality.
            <br><b>Common scales</b>:
            <br> - <b>Functional Independence Measure Scale (FIM)</b>: Assesses physical and cognitive function focusing
            on burden of care (13 motor, 5 social-cognitive items, scored 1-7, with 7 being complete independence).
            <br> - <b>Modified Rankin Scale</b>: A global outcome scale (0-6, with 0 for perfect health and 6 for death)
            commonly used for measuring disability/dependence in stroke clinical trials.
