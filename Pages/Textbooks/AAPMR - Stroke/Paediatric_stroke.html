    <h1>### Pediatric Stroke Part 1: Disease/Disorder and Essentials of Assessment</h1>
    
    <h2>#### Disease/Disorder</h2>
    
    <p>
        <br><br><b>Definition</b>: Stroke describes a <b>cerebrovascular event</b> that disrupts blood flow to a brain region. This encompasses conditions such as <b>arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), cerebral venous thromboembolism, infarction, and non-traumatic brain hemorrhage</b>.
        <br><br><b>Etiology</b>:
            <br><b>Hemorrhagic stroke</b> occurs due to ruptured intracranial vessels bleeding into tissues, often caused by <b>arteriovenous malformation (AVM), aneurysm, traumatic injury, hematological disorders, brain tumors</b>, or rare conditions like moyamoya disease or septicemia. The most common site for hemorrhage is cerebral, followed by intraventricular and subarachnoid.
            <br><b>Ischemic strokes</b> result from interrupted blood flow due to inadequate systolic cardiac function, inappropriate vasoconstriction, or thromboembolic occlusion. <b>Arteriopathies</b> are the most significant risk factor for AIS. The Childhood AIS Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) criteria classify strokes by distribution and progression, including small vessel, focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA), bilateral cerebral, aortic/cervical, cardioembolic, and multifactorial types.
            <br><b>Perinatal AIS</b> is often multifactorial, linked to the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and maternal-fetal circulation interactions. Infection, congenital heart disease, and hypercoagulable disorders are consistently associated with perinatal AIS.
        <br><br><b>Epidemiology including risk factors and primary prevention</b>:
            <br>   The estimated <b>incidence of stroke in children ranges from 2 to 13 per 100,000 children per year</b>.
            <br><b>Pediatric Stroke based on age</b>:
                <br>  -    <b>Perinatal stroke</b>: Occurs <b>before 29 days of life</b>, with an incidence of 1 in 2300 to 5000 births.
                <br>  -    <b>Childhood stroke</b>: Occurs <b>between 29 days and 20 years of age</b>, with an incidence of 2-13 per 100,000.
            <br><b>Pediatric Stroke by etiology</b>:
                <br>  -    <b>Hemorrhagic Stroke</b> impacts 2.3 million individuals under 20 years, with an average annual incidence of 1.4 per 100,000 children.
                <br>  -    <b>Ischemic strokes are more common</b>, especially among younger children and males, with annual incidence rates from 0.6 to 7.9 per 100,000 children per year, constituting about <b>55% of pediatric strokes</b>.
                <br>  -    <b>Moyamoya and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)</b> are significant sources of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in children after the first year of life. Moyamoya disease, an arteriopathy of unknown origin, affects internal carotid artery branches and can be isolated or associated with systemic disorders. It is implicated in 6% of pediatric ischemic strokes, with higher incidence in East Asian populations. AVMs are the most frequent intracranial circulatory abnormality and a leading cause of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in pediatric cases.
            <br><b>Pediatric Stroke by ethnicity</b>:
                <br>  -    Asians and African Americans have a higher risk of AIS.
                <br>  -    Moyamoya disease is the most common pediatric cerebrovascular disease in East Asian populations.
                <br>  -    African Americans are affected more often than Caucasians or Hispanics, even when controlling for sickle cell disease (SCD). <b>SCD is a very common cause of pediatric stroke</b>, affecting 11% of patients by age 20.
        <br><br><b>Morbidity and Mortality</b>: Pediatric stroke leads to significant morbidity and mortality. <b>Roughly 10–25% of children with a stroke will die</b>. Up to 25% may have recurrence, and up to 66% will experience persistent neurological deficits or develop seizure disorders, learning, or developmental problems.
        <br><br><b>Risk factors</b>: Primary risk factors include <b>vasculopathies (AVM, Moyamoya disease), infections, cardiac issues, and coagulopathies</b>. Other factors are hematological and renal diseases, autoimmune disorders, and head trauma.
        <br><br><b>Primary prevention in select populations</b>:
            <br><b>Sickle cell disease</b>: Periodic blood transfusion is recommended to reduce first stroke risk if transcranial Doppler studies show high velocity flow in the middle cerebral or distal internal carotid artery. Hydroxyurea is also indicated to prevent sickling.
            <br><b>Routine vaccines</b> are thought to protect against pediatric stroke, likely due to direct protective effects against infections.
        <br><br><b>Patho-anatomy/physiology</b>: The <b>middle cerebral artery is the most commonly affected distribution in ischemic strokes</b>, while hemorrhagic strokes are typically supratentorial. Cellular damage in ischemic strokes leads to enzyme activation, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, and reactive oxygen species generation, followed by inflammatory cell migration and further alterations.
        <br><br><b>Disease progression including natural history, disease phases or stages, disease trajectory</b>:
            <br><b>New onset/acute</b>: Characterized by <b>abrupt onset of focal neurologic signs or rapid decline</b>, with altered mental status or seizure as potential sole symptoms. Intracranial hemorrhage may present with nausea, vomiting, and headache. Seizures are common, especially in neonatal AIS (94%). Symptoms can be subtle in infants, including decreased consciousness, headache, and vomiting, but hemiparesis and facial weakness are also seen. Diagnosis is often delayed due to low prevalence awareness and different risk factors compared to adults. The <b>FAST criteria (Face, Arms, Speech Time)</b> are used for screening.
            <br><b>Subacute</b>: Patients with previously unrecognized strokes may present with <b>stepwise or progressive decline</b> in function over time.
            <br><b>Chronic/stable</b>: Over 50% of pediatric stroke patients will have <b>long-lasting or permanent neurologic sequelae</b>. Most achieve independence in ADLs, but younger age may limit progress in new skill acquisition. Regression in function is rare, and new deficits should prompt suspicion of recurrent stroke.
        <br><br><b>Specific secondary or associated conditions and complications</b>: These include:
            <br>   Neurologic deficits (moderate to severe impairment)
            <br>   Hemiparesis
            <br>   Cerebral Palsy
            <br>   Seizure disorder (Epilepsy in up to 50%, Infantile Spasm in about 25%)
            <br>   Hemiplegia/quadriplegia
            <br>   Spasticity
            <br>   Visual deficits
            <br>   Speech and language impairment
            <br>   Dysphagia (around 40% in neonates and children)
            <br>   Oral motor and Motor speech impairments (around 25% in children and neonates)
            <br>   Cognitive impairment
            <br>   Head Growth Deceleration (associated with poor outcomes)
            <br>   Obstructive Sleep Apnea

    <h2>#### Essentials of Assessment</h2>
    
    <p>
        <br><br><b>History</b>: A thorough history should include:
            <br>   Time of symptom onset
            <br>   Specific sensory or motor deficits, vision changes, dysphagia
            <br>   Seizure activity
            <br>   Headache
            <br>   Trauma
            <br>   Screening for potential risk factors, including recent infections
            <br>   Birth and developmental history
            <br>   Family history of clots, miscarriages, drug exposure
        <br><br><b>Physical examination</b>:
            <br>   Initial: <b>Monitor vital signs, document seizure activity, look for signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema)</b>. A full neurologic exam is essential.
            <br>   Later stages: Assess ADL skills, transfer skills, and other functional mobility.
        <br><br><b>Functional assessment</b>:
            <br>   The <b>Pediatric NIH Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS)</b> quantifies short-term stroke severity.
            <br>   The <b>Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM)</b> predicts long-term functional outcomes and is a standard of care for comprehensive evaluation.
        <br><br><b>Laboratory studies</b>: May include:
            <br>   Complete blood count (for anemia, platelet disorders)
            <br>   Metabolic panel (for electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration)
            <br>   Coagulation panel (various factors and antibodies)
            <br>   Inflammatory markers (ESR, C-reactive protein)
            <br>   Maternal labs for syphilis testing and toxicology screen
        <br><br><b>Imaging</b>:
            <br><b>MRI is preferred for first-line imaging</b> if available and the child is clinically stable. If not, CT brain can be used. CT/MRI helps differentiate hemorrhagic from ischemic lesions, guiding thrombolytic use.
            <br>   CT brain quickly depicts superficial or hemorrhagic lesions but can miss venous thrombosis and early acute ischemic stroke (up to 47%).
            <br><b>MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic venography (MRV)</b> more accurately define arterial or venous occlusions without ionizing radiation and show parenchymal abnormalities.
            <br><b>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)</b> can confirm infarction presence and location earlier than other sequences or CT.
            <br>   Advanced MRI techniques are emerging.
            <br>   CT angiography (CTA) is accurate for primary vascular abnormalities with hemorrhagic lesions but may not differentiate stroke from mimics. It involves radiation and contrast, making it not first-line.
            <br>   Catheter angiography (CA) is technically difficult in babies and usually reserved for anticipated endovascular surgery.
            <br>   Vascular imaging (MRI or CTA) is often done at the same time or after initial imaging due to high likelihood of arteriopathy, which is a poor prognostic factor and increases recurrence risk. <b>Follow-up imaging 6 to 12 weeks after initial stroke is recommended</b>.
        <br><br><b>Supplemental assessment tools</b>:
            <br><b>ECG and echocardiogram</b> are obtained after AIS to check for arrhythmia, thrombus, or congenital cardiac defects.
            <br><b>EEG</b> can show generalized activity suppression or subtle focal seizure activity.
            <br><b>Neuropsychology testing</b> is important for assessing cognitive and memory deficits.
        <br><br><b>Environmental</b>: Prior to discharge, consider the <b>physical accessibility</b> of the child’s destination and discuss equipment or home adaptation needs with caregivers.
        <br><br><b>Social role and social support system</b>: Caregivers may need to provide more assistance. <b>Functional parenting styles, positive discipline, and autonomy-supportive strategies</b> should be encouraged. Mentoring support groups like hemi-kids and CHASA are available.
        <br><br><b>Mental health</b>: <b>Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</b> are common in both the child and family members (mothers, fathers) post-stroke.

    <h1>### Pediatric Stroke Part 2: Rehabilitation Management and Treatments, Cutting Edge Concepts, and Gaps in the Evidence</h1>
    
    <h2>#### Rehabilitation Management and Treatments</h2>
    
    <p>
        <br><br><b>Available or current treatment guidelines</b>:
            <br>   Evidence-based research for pediatric stroke is limited, but guidelines exist from the <b>American Heart Association (AHA), Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations, and Australian clinical consensus guideline</b>.
            <br><b>AHA "Considerations for Clinical Practice" (2019) supports</b>: age-appropriate rehabilitation, psychological assessment for cognitive/language deficits, <b>constraint therapy for unilateral hand dysfunction</b>, and long-term follow-up for developing concerns.
            <br><b>2015 Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations support</b>:
                <br>  -    <b>Level A Evidence</b>: <b>Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy</b> for upper limb impairment.
                <br>  -    <b>Level B Evidence</b>: <b>Rapid initial assessment</b> for stroke severity and rehab needs; acute and rehabilitation care in a <b>specialized pediatric unit</b>; outpatient support for changes in functional status. Care should be provided by <b>experienced pediatric stroke health professionals</b>. The team should include physicians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and dietitians. Education should be provided to reduce maternal guilt or parental blame.
                <br>  -    <b>Level C Evidence</b>: <b>Individualized rehabilitation plans and annual developmental updates</b>. Rehabilitation should be <b>meaningful, engaging, age-appropriate, task-specific, goal-oriented, repetitive, and progressively adapted</b>. Training should encourage affected limb use in functional tasks mimicking daily life.
                <br>  -    For upper limbs: safe positioning, <b>Functional Electric Stimulation, Mirror Therapy, Botulinum Toxin Type A, Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or Surgical Interventions</b>.
                <br>  -    For lower limbs: range of motion exercises, gait training, physical activity, <b>Ankle-Foot Orthoses, Botulinum Toxin Type A, or Surgical Interventions</b>.
                <br>  -    Adaptive devices (splints, wheelchair trays) and special equipment should be used with monitoring.
                <br>  -    School-aged children need educational rehabilitation, support services, and an <b>Individualized Educational Plan (IEP)</b>.
            <br><b>Australian Clinical Consensus Guideline (2021) further supports</b>:
                <br>  -    Individualized therapy and educational programs based on thorough assessment by multiple team members.
                <br>  -    Criteria for transferring from acute to subacute rehab: medical stability, functional change benefiting rehab, and rehab goals.
                <br>  -    Criteria for transferring from subacute to long-term community care: child's safety, community-better addressed goals, and family readiness.
                <br>  -    <b>Group therapy can supplement individualized therapy</b> for generic goals, social/communication skills, or common physical skills. Individualized therapy is for specific goals, cognitive dysfunction, frequent modifications, or privacy.
                <br>  -    <b>Environmental adaptations</b> (utensils, home mods, Velcro) improve ADLs.
                <br>  -    <b>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)</b> is feasible for upper limb strength.
                <br>  -    <b>Graded sensory exposure and vision for sensory feedback</b> address sensory difficulties.
                <br>  -    <b>Multidisciplinary pain management</b> including meds, prevention, and psychological support.
                <br>  -    <b>Dietary changes, food consistency modification, and techniques (chin tuck, head rotation, double swallow)</b> for dysphagia/poor nutrition; severe dysphagia may require nasogastric tubes or gastrostomy.
                <br>  -    <b>Articulation or phonological therapy</b> for speech intelligibility.
                <br>  -    <b>Augmentative and alternative communication</b> (Dynavox, picture boards, gestures, tablets).
                <br>  -    <b>Compensation techniques</b> (written instructions, schedules) for memory issues.
                <br>  -    Education for parents, teachers, and community on emotional/behavioral impact.
                <br>  -    <b>Graded return to school</b> with curriculum adjustments and Individual Learning Plan.
        <br><br><b>At different disease stages</b>:
            <br><b>New onset/acute</b>:
                <br>  -    Begins with <b>supportive care</b> including hydration, hypoxia/hypotension/seizure management, and monitoring for increased intracranial pressure.
                <br>  -    <b>MR imaging within 1 hour</b> of hospital arrival if available.
                <br>  -    <b>Intravenous thrombolysis (tPA)</b> can be offered within 4.5 hours for patients 2 years or older with PedNIHSS 4-24, confirmed absence of hemorrhage, and arterial occlusion/stenosis.
                <br>  -    Early involvement of neurology and pediatric hematology/stroke consult is vital for timely thrombolytic decisions.
                <br>  -    Adult stroke trial results for antithrombotic treatments are not directly applicable to children due to different thrombus formation.
                <br>  -    The <b>Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke (TIPS) trial</b> was defunded but its protocol showed <b>low risk of intracranial hemorrhage with tPA (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg) in children</b>.
                <br>  -    Heparin is not widely used for perinatal AIS, but may benefit those with severe pro-thrombotic disorders or cardiac/multiple systemic thrombi. Anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH is suggested for neonates with first AIS and a cardioembolic source.
                <br>  -    <b>Insufficient evidence for mechanical thrombectomy in children younger than 12 months</b>.
                <br>  -    <b>Mechanical thrombectomy is an option for ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion in patients aged 1-18 years</b>.
                <br>  -    Surgical evacuation of hemorrhage is not typical but may be useful for refractory increased intracranial pressure. Markedly low platelet counts and factor deficiencies should be corrected.
            <br><b>Sub-acute, chronic/stable</b>:
                <br>  -    <b>Sickle cell patients with confirmed infarct require long-term red blood cell transfusions</b> for secondary prevention; hydroxyurea is an alternative. Stopping transfusions increases stroke risk.
                <br>  -    <b>Congenital vascular abnormalities (e.g., AVMs)</b> should be treated with surgery, endovascular repair, or radiosurgery.
                <br>  -    <b>Moyamoya syndrome</b> primary treatment is <b>surgical revascularization</b>.
                <br>  -    Heparin therapy for <b>extracranial arterial dissection or cardioembolism</b> can transition to warfarin (3-6 months for dissection, 1 year+ for cardioembolic).
                <br>  -    Oral contraceptives are linked to cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, so other birth control should be considered.
                <br>  -    <b>Folic acid</b> can decrease sequelae in those with elevated homocysteine levels; diet changes and supplementation are recommended.
                <br>  -    Aspirin and anticoagulation with LMWH are generally not indicated for neonates due to low recurrence risk, but can be used for high-risk recurrent AIS (e.g., thrombophilia, congenital heart disease).
        <br><br><b>Rehabilitation strategies</b>: Include <b>orthotics, adaptive equipment, and medical management of spasticity</b>. The entire family should be considered due to potential parental guilt. Goals can include education, vocational rehabilitation, and adult-like goals. An <b>Individualized Education Plan (IEP)</b> should be made, providing information about school resources and how to request a 504 plan or IEP.
        <br><br><b>Coordination of care</b>:
            <br><b>Multidisciplinary teams are the standard</b>.
            <br>   Acute care: critical care, neurology, hematology, trauma, neurosurgery, care coordination, physiatry.
            <br>   Rehabilitation: physiatry, pediatrics, PT, OT, speech therapy, neuropsychology, dietician, child life, recreational therapies, care coordinators, social workers, nursing, teachers, and follow-up from acute care services.
        <br><br><b>Patient & family education</b>: A balance of <b>honesty about long-term deficits and strong recovery potential</b> is warranted. The <b>Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA)</b> is an excellent resource.
        <br><br><b>Emerging/unique interventions</b>: The Pediatric Stroke Outcomes Measure, Pediatric Stroke Recurrence and Recovery Questionnaire, and the PedNIHSS were developed specifically for pediatric stroke outcomes.
        <br><br><b>Translation into practice: practice “pearls”/performance improvement in practice (PIPs)/changes in clinical practice behaviors and skills</b>:
            <br><b>Keep stroke in the differential diagnosis for children with neurologic complaints, headache, or vomiting</b> due to common misdiagnosis/delayed diagnosis.
            <br><b>Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) significantly improves functional outcomes</b>, with hemorrhagic strokes showing better results than ischemic.
            <br>   Educate primary physicians and parents of pediatric stroke survivors.
            <br>   Encourage <b>early referrals</b> for IPR (median time to admission is 78 days from symptom onset).
            <br>   Pediatric stroke survivors may have <b>worse academic achievement</b>, especially in mathematics. <b>Neuropsychology screening</b> is recommended for potential higher-level learning difficulties.
            <br><b>Individualized education plans</b> are recommended.
            <br>   Poorer quality of life is associated with neurological impairment severity, female sex, younger age at onset, cognitive function, self-esteem, and family factors.
            <br><b>Arteriopathy is the most important predictor of recurrent AIS</b> (>65% recurrence rates).
            <br>   Children may be able to define their own goals in rehabilitation.

    <h2>#### Cutting Edge/Emerging and Unique Concepts and Practice</h2>
    
    <p>
        <br><br><b>Robotic therapies</b> for upper extremity function, including virtual reality and electromechanical assisted gait training, are being explored for pediatric stroke, building on their use in adults and children with cerebral palsy. Effective methods include CIMT, forced use therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and robotics.
        <br><br><b>Implanted brain-computer interfaces</b> show potential for improving limb function.
    </p>
    
    <h2>#### Gaps in the Evidence-Based Knowledge</h2>
    
    <p>
        <br><br><b>Extensive pediatric stroke research is limited</b> due to its low incidence and challenges in diagnosis (varied presentation, age-specific symptoms). Diverse risk factors (sepsis, dehydration, hypoxia, congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease) make large studies difficult.
        <br><br><b>Mechanical thrombectomy reports show inconsistencies</b> and may not be as beneficial as implied.
        <br><br>   Recent evidence suggests <b>genetic variances</b>, such as in <b>ADAMTS12, ANCC6, and COL4A1</b>, may increase the likelihood of pediatric stroke.
        <br><br><b>Pediatric stroke is an infrequent but important complication of COVID-19</b>, with case reports noting strokes 3-4 weeks post-infection, though the overall effect is unknown.
