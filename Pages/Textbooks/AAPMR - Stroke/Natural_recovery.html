    <h1>Natural Recovery and Regeneration of the Central Nervous System</h1>
    <h2>Overview and Description</h2>
    <p>
        
            <br><br>Historical Context and Recent Advances</b>: While scientific doctrine traditionally held that central nervous system (CNS) axons have <b>limited regenerative capacity</b> after injuries like stroke, brain injury, or spinal cord injury, recent advances in understanding natural recovery and regeneration of CNS tissue represent significant developments in physiatry and neurorehabilitation.
            <br><br>Research Focus</b>: Ongoing research is directed towards understanding <b>axon regeneration, neuronal survival, and myelination</b>. Studies on the spinal cord and visual system are providing valuable insights into recovery and regeneration mechanisms.
            <br><br>CNS vs. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</b>:
                <br>  -    The <b>PNS has the ability to regenerate</b>, unlike the CNS.
                <br>  -    During development, <b>CNS neurons lose their regenerative ability</b> due to inhibitory factors and a lack of myelin clearance, which contributes to a toxic environment preventing repair and regeneration.
            <br><br>Neurogenesis</b>: This is the process where new nerve cells develop through differentiation from undifferentiated neural progenitor or stem cells. It begins during prenatal development and continues in the hippocampus and subventricular area of the adult brain.
            <br><br>Mechanisms of Brain Plasticity</b>: Neurogenesis is one of three mechanisms of plasticity in the brain, along with synaptic plasticity and functional compensatory processing.
                <br>  - <b>Synaptic plasticity</b> enhances neural transmission by improving synapses.
                <br>  - <b>Functional compensatory processing</b> builds alternate circuits by recruiting inactive areas.
                <br>  -    The significant advantage of <b>neurogenesis</b> is its ability to <b>replace injured tissue with cells that mirror it in structural anatomy and function</b>.
            <br><br>Spinal Cord Injury Research</b>:
                <br>  -    Historically, many research efforts focused on neuroprotection rather than regeneration due to the perception of limited repair potential for CNS axons in the spinal cord.
                <br>  -    More recently, animal studies have demonstrated that CNS axons in the mammalian spinal cord <b>can regenerate if provided with a non-inhibitory environment</b>.
                <br>  -    Neural progenitor cell grafts have been shown to assist corticospinal motor axons in reinnervating neurons distal to the lesion, suggesting reinnervation is possible without typical guidance cueing.
                <br>  -    A growing body of research explores whether <b>stem cell therapies, cell/tissue transplants, growth factors, biomaterials, genetic manipulations, or combinations</b> can lead to axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury.
            <br><br>Immune System's Role in Debris Clearance Post-Injury</b>:
                <br>  - <b>CNS</b>: Microglia and Astrocytes are involved in clearing damaged axons. Microglia induce cytotoxic cytokines like TNF and IL-A. Oligodendrocytes myelinate CNS axons but do not assist with repair. Debris clearing takes approximately <b>three months</b>. Microglia are crucial for the protective scar that forms, as their depletion leads to disorganized astrocyte scarring and impaired recovery.
                <br>  - <b>PNS</b>: Schwann cells, with macrophages, clear debris and differentiate into repair cells, <b>speeding up recovery</b> to about <b>one month</b>.
            <br><br>Stem Cell Research for CNS Regeneration</b>:
                <br>  -    Successful neurogenesis requires undifferentiated neural progenitor or stem cells to survive and differentiate correctly.
                <br>  -    Most research focuses on <b>multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) and neural stem cell (NSC) therapies</b>.
                <br>  - <b>MSCs</b> (from bone marrow, cord blood, placenta, adipose tissues) are hypothesized to provide a supportive environment by promoting endogenous neurogenesis and angiogenesis, reducing inflammation, and exerting immunomodulatory and hormonal effects.
                <br>  - <b>NSCs</b> can be obtained directly from primary CNS tissues (fetal/adult brain, spinal cord), differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (embryonic, induced pluripotent), or trans-differentiated from somatic cells.
            <br><br>Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs)</b>: These CNS neurons are studied for regenerative properties. Some die quickly after injury, while others survive for about 8 days. They are targets for drug treatments. Higher concentrations of certain growth factors in RGCs in mammals suggest their resilience, and other neuroprotective genes and transcription factors are being studied.
            <br><br>Role of Physical Activity</b>: Numerous studies investigate the role of physical activity in facilitating neurogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and age-related cognitive decline, even without acute CNS injury.

        </p>

    <h2>Relevance to Clinical Practice</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Current Limitations</b>: Despite exciting research developments that may stimulate neurogenesis and improve functional recovery, clinicians currently face an absence of commercially available treatments beyond standard rehabilitation, compensatory strategies, and general health maintenance (e.g., regular physical activity and preventive care).
            <br><br>Translational Challenges</b>: While animal studies have shown success in curing some CNS disorders, there has not been a successful transition to curing the same CNS disorders in humans.
            <br><br>Patient Inquiries</b>: Individuals with CNS injury and neurodegenerative disease may inquire about experimental clinical trials for novel therapies.
            <br><br>Ongoing Research Trials</b>:
                <br>  -    The <b>Mayo Clinic</b> has ongoing trials for Alzheimer’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple sclerosis, among others.
                <br>  -    These trials investigate <b>stem cell use, gene therapy, and growth factor-driven tissue restoration</b> in the CNS.
                <br>  -    Examples include studying growth factors for spinal cord axon regeneration in rats and mice for human application, using zebrafish to understand nerve cell development and regeneration, and observing improved limb function in animal models of hemorrhagic stroke treated with mesenchymal stem cells.
                <br>  -    Kallikreins are being targeted to prevent inflammatory cascades after CNS trauma.
                <br>  - <b>Deep brain stimulation (DBS)</b> to the fornix and hypothalamus has been reported to improve memory and decrease cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer’s, and researchers are investigating its potential as a treatment.
            <br><br>Clinician-Patient Communication</b>: Clinicians should maintain an open and transparent attitude when discussing novel treatments, be willing to engage patients and families, have working knowledge of current clinical trial resources, and respect patient autonomy and choices.
        </p>

    <h2>Cutting Edge/Unique Concepts/Emerging Issues</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Availability of Novel Treatments</b>: These are currently available only to eligible participants of clinical experimental research trials.
            <br><br>Unestablished Parameters and Safety Concerns</b>:
                <br>  -    The <b>optimal delivery route, method, dosage, and timing</b> for cell-based treatments, novel biomaterials, pharmaceutical compounds, and growth factors have yet to be established.
                <br>  - <b>Toxicities and unintended effects</b>, especially potential <b>long-term side effects</b>, have not been conclusively established.
            <br><br>Tumorigenesis Risk</b>: <b>Tumorigenesis remains a significant concern</b> as a potential long-term complication for trials involving undifferentiated neural progenitor or stem cells, based on animal models and human case reports. The <b>upregulation of pro-growth factors can lead to tumorigenesis</b>, which has led many studies to shift focus to axon repair and regeneration rather than solely relying on growth factors.
        </p>

    <h2>Gaps in Knowledge/Evidence Base</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Focus of Current Studies</b>: Most human clinical studies of stem cell therapy for neurogenesis following CNS injury are currently aimed at <b>establishing safety and efficacy based on dosing parameters</b>.
            <br><br>Lack of Large-Scale Studies</b>: <b>Large-scale, population-based studies</b> of novel therapeutic techniques are lacking and difficult to perform due to patient selection restrictions in preliminary investigations.
            <br><br>Challenges with Unproven Therapies</b>: Clinicians may face practical challenges when discussing novel treatments with individuals who have received information on <b>unproven therapies marketed as direct-to-consumer treatments</b> that lack thorough testing or safety oversight.
            <br><br>Ethical and Regulatory Awareness</b>: Clinicians and researchers must maintain awareness of industry standards for informed consent for novel therapeutic treatments, potential ethical issues in experimental clinical trials, and consumer-facing resources and educational materials.

    <h1>Brain Plasticity and Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Historical Belief vs. Recent Understanding</b>: Historically, it was believed that brain structures and functions lost due to incidents like stroke were lost forever. However, recent advancements have significantly increased our understanding of motor learning, neuroplasticity, and functional recovery after brain lesions.
            <br><br>Brain Plasticity Defined</b>: The brain exhibits an intrinsic capacity to act as a highly dynamic system, able to change the properties of its neural circuits. This brain plasticity can lead to substantial spontaneous recovery, and rehabilitative training can modify and enhance these neuronal plasticity processes.
            <br><br>Goal of Recovery</b>: The most successful recoveries are generally associated with a greater return towards the normal state of brain functional organization. This behavioral recovery is supported by the reorganization of surviving central nervous system (CNS) elements, which includes changes in interhemispheric lateralization, activity of association cortices linked to injured areas, and the organization of cortical representational maps.
            <br><br>Mechanisms of Plasticity</b>: Plasticity mechanisms involve activity-dependent rewiring and the strengthening of synapses.
            <br><br>Rehabilitation's Role</b>: Rehabilitative training is considered the most successful therapy for enhancing functional recovery. It operates as evidence-based medicine, aiming to help patients reach and maintain optimal functioning across physical, intellectual, psychological, and social domains. Improved function is linked to the remodeling of intact cortical structures. The principle that neural recovery depends on <b>active skilled use</b> has become well-accepted, leading to cortical motor map reorganization from skilled training.
            <br><br>Challenges and Future Directions</b>: A primary challenge for improving stroke recovery is to understand how to optimally engage and modify surviving neuronal networks to create new response strategies that compensate for lost tissue. The direct application of physical modalities to the cerebral cortex is a relatively new area of investigation in rehabilitation. Currently, the optimal timing for different processes and therapeutic interventions, as well as their interactions, are not fully understood. Designing optimal rehabilitation paradigms requires aligning neural plasticity processes with interventions based on defined "plastic time windows".
        </p>
    
    <h2>Brain Plasticity and Rehabilitation in Animals</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Neural Circuit Remodeling</b>: Studies in animal models have shown that novel neuronal circuits, mediating responses to sensory vibratory stimulation of impaired limbs, can develop in the intact somatosensory cortex within weeks after a focal infarction and become established by four weeks.
            <br><br>Cortical Activation Shifts</b>: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in rats have revealed a shift in laterality of brain activation after stroke. Early after stroke, activation during affected paw stimulation is primarily in the <b>contralesional cortex</b>; later, activity shifts towards the normal pattern, which is the ipsilesional (affected) cortex. Larger ischemic insults correlate with stronger activity in the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1).
            <br><br>Correlates of Functional Recovery</b>: Functional recovery in rats correlates with the extent of <b>preservation or restoration of the ipsilesional corticospinal tract</b>, along with the reinstatement of inter-hemispheric neuronal signal synchronization and normalization of focal network organization. Good functional outcomes are specifically linked to preserved or repaired structural integrity within the ipsilesional corticospinal tract.
            <br><br>Neuronal Takeover and Axon Sprouting</b>: If the forelimb M1 in rats is destroyed, neurons in the hindlimb area can take over to enable functional recovery of the forelimbs. This functional shift is based on the <b>sprouting of new axon branches</b> from hindlimb corticospinal fibers into the cervical spinal cord, followed by the retraction of the original lumbar projecting axons, effectively converting a hindlimb-projecting neuron into a forelimb-projecting one.
            <br><br>Importance of Early Rehabilitation</b>: The most significant gains in recovery of skilled forelimb reaching ability were achieved when rehabilitation was initiated early (e.g., 5 days) after stroke, compared to delays of 14 or 30 days. Early rehabilitation was associated with increased dendritic branching of layer V M1 neurons in the unlesioned hemisphere.
            <br><br>Interaction of Growth Promotion and Training</b>: Near full recovery in rats with large strokes was achieved when a growth-promoting immunotherapy was applied to boost new fiber sprouting <br><br>before<br><br> stabilizing circuits with intensive training. Crucially, <b>early high-intensity training during the growth phase destroyed this effect</b> and led to aberrant fiber patterns. This suggests the existence of <b>critical time windows</b> during which the brain is most responsive to growth-promoting agents and training-dependent plasticity.
            <br><br>Diaschisis</b>: This refers to reduced activity (e.g., blood flow or metabolism) in uninjured brain areas that are richly connected to injured areas. Behavioral recovery can be related to the resolution of this diaschisis, meaning the restitution of brain activity in these distant, connected areas.
            <br><br>Motor Training's Effect</b>: While rehabilitative training rapidly improves motor performance, these training-induced improvements may not be reflected in spared motor maps until much later, suggesting that early motor training helps shape the evolving post-stroke neural network.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Brain Plasticity and Rehabilitation in Humans</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Functional Neuroimaging Insights</b>: Recent advancements in human brain activity imaging (PET, fMRI) reveal that the <b>contralesional cortical hemisphere plays an important role</b> in the recovery process after stroke. Compensation occurring in the intact hemisphere is crucial for optimizing functional recovery in human stroke patients.
            <br><br>Challenges in Translational Research</b>: Many basic mechanisms of how the brain learns by repetition and training are still poorly understood, and there are no generally accepted guidelines regarding the timing, type, or intensity of stroke rehabilitation. Translating successful animal study results to human rehabilitation schedules has been difficult. Most clinical studies in humans have focused on chronic stroke patients (>6 months post-stroke) where performance has stabilized, suggesting that functional outcome improvements in these cases might largely stem from compensatory techniques.
            <br><br>Recovery Timelines</b>: Recovery time courses differ between species; while rodent models reach maximum recovery around 4 weeks after stroke, human stroke survivors complete most of their recovery within 3 months.
            <br><br>NIRS for Prediction and Tailoring</b>: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to predict the potential for clinical improvement in chronic stroke patients. Evaluating brain function using a combination of neurophysiological measures and imaging can inform therapeutic effectiveness and patient selection for specific rehabilitation programs, leading to the conceptualization of <b>individually tailored rehabilitation strategies</b>.
            <br><br>Therapeutic Approaches</b>: Direct electrical or magnetic stimulation of the peripheral or central nervous system may enhance neuroplasticity during post-stroke rehabilitation. Increased excitability in the stroke-affected ipsilesional M1 (primary motor cortex) through electrical devices has been shown to improve motor outcomes. The mechanisms behind these techniques may involve changes in synaptic activity, gene expression, and levels of neurotransmitters, receptors, or neurotrophins, or even enhanced fiber sprouting.
            <br><br>Motor Cortex Reorganization</b>: The organization of the motor cortex after stroke is related to the side of the stroke and the level of recovery achieved.
            <br><br>Three Major Phases of Stroke Reaction and Repair</b>:
                1.  <b>Acute Reaction</b>: Occurs in the <b>initial hours</b> after injury, involving apparent modifications in blood flow, edema, metabolism, and inflammation.
                2.  <b>Repair-Related Epoch</b>: Begins in the <b>first days post-stroke and continues for several weeks</b>. During this phase, spontaneous recovery is observed, and endogenous repair-related events reach their peak levels.
                3.  <b>Chronic Phase</b>: Commences <b>weeks to months after stroke</b>, once spontaneous recovery has plateaued. This phase represents a stable but still modifiable state.
                <br>  -    Figure 1 illustrates the physiological recovery mechanism of hemiparesis. Initially, facilitation of the non-affected side motor-related area improves hemiparesis. This non-affected side activity decreases around half to one year after stroke onset, and finally, an increase in activity in the affected side motor-related area becomes crucial for recovery.
            <br><br>Forms of Reaction to Stroke in Distributed Networks</b>:
                1.  <b>Increased Cortical Excitability</b>: Observed in cortical regions distant from but connected to the stroke core. Widespread areas of cortical hyperactivity appear days after stroke and diminish within months.
                2.  <b>Reduced Lateralized Activation</b>: Reflects increased activity in the contralesional hemisphere, which reduces the extent of interhemispheric balance. Both increased cortical excitability and reduced laterality are related to spontaneous functional recovery and are time-dependent, increasing early after stroke and decreasing over months. Poorer outcomes are associated with persistent increased activity over both hemispheres.
                3.  <b>Somatotopic Reorganization</b>: Intact cortical regions, particularly within the perinfarct area, reassign their pre-stroke functions to take over functions affected or lost by the ischemic event. This map shifting can occur in primary and secondary cortical areas, with the largest degree of reorganization sometimes associated with very large stroke injuries.
            <br><br>NIBS (Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation) in Neuro-rehabilitation</b>:
                <br>  -    Novel treatments like magnetic or electrical stimulation show promise for improving motor recovery, especially when combined with intensive motor relearning.
                <br>  - <b>TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) and Connectivity</b>: Facilitatory stimulation of the ipsilesional M1 increases its functional connectivity with the supplementary motor area. Inhibitory stimulation of the contralesional M1 can decrease contralesional connectivity while strengthening ipsilesional connectivity, a pattern linked to improved motor performance. Stimulation of areas other than M1 also induces substantial changes in connectivity in interconnected brain regions.
                <br>  - <b>tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation)</b>: Applied over a specific region, tDCS can induce distant effects on network connectivity that may impact behavior.
                <br>  -    Strategies like upregulating activity in the ipsilesional M1 or downregulating activity in the contralesional M1 are proposed to improve motor control. Studies have shown that increasing ipsilesional M1 excitability through high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) or anodal tDCS can improve motor performance. Similarly, downregulating excitability in the contralesional motor cortex using low-frequency rTMS or cathodal tDCS has been associated with motor gains. Some of these changes are believed to outlast the stimulation period.
            <br><br>Role of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in Brain Plasticity</b>:
                <br>  -    FES can influence peripheral nerves by changing axonal conduction velocities, axonal growth, and myelination. Its exact role in CNS plasticity is still being clarified.
                <br>  -    FES does not acutely provide neuroprotection but highlights the importance of cortical plasticity in adjacent preserved regions for behavioral motor recovery. Therapies that temporally link motor output and sensory feedback from the affected limb may facilitate neuroplastic changes leading to motor recovery.
                <br>  -    Hebbian mechanisms suggest that rehabilitation generating synchronous presynaptic and postsynaptic neural activity along motor and sensory pathways can facilitate synaptic remodeling and neural reorganization. FES maximizes this by tightly coupling and coordinating motor output with corresponding muscle and joint proprioceptive feedback.
                <br>  - <b>NIRS for Monitoring FES</b>: Unlike fMRI, SPECT, and PET, NIRS is not affected by electrical stimulation, making it suitable for assessing brain activity during FES in rehabilitation settings. NIRS is non-invasive, portable, and measures changes in hemoglobin concentration that reflect cortical activation.
                <br>  - <b>EMG-controlled FES (EMG-FES)</b>: Studies using EMG-FES, which induces muscle contraction proportional to the electromyography signal, showed an <b>increase in the spatial extent of activation in the sensory motor cortex (SMC)</b> in stroke patients during and after therapy. There was more oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration in the ipsilesional SMC during EMG-FES compared to voluntary movement alone, while simple electrical stimulation without voluntary movement showed very low Oxy-Hb.
                <br>  - <b>SMC Perfusion Shift</b>: Prior to EMG-FES treatment, most subjects exhibited dominant perfusion in the contralesional SMC, but after treatment, the dominant perfusion in SMC tended to shift to the ipsilesional side. This shift in SMC activity was induced by EMG-controlled FES.
                <br>  - <b>Clinical Implications</b>: A 5-month EMG-FES treatment induced functional recovery in the hemiparetic hand of chronic stroke patients, correlating with increases in cortical perfusion patterns. This suggests that sensory motor integration from EMG-FES may facilitate ipsilesional SMC perfusion, leading to functional improvement. EMG-FES is considered more effective for increasing activation of the ipsilesional SMC in patients with moderate to severe motor impairment than active voluntary motion and simple electrical stimulation. Treatment-driven clinical improvements in chronic stroke patients are directly related to cortical-level reorganization.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Future Directions or Designing Optimal Neuro-rehabilitation</h2>
        <p>
            <br><br>Critical Time Windows</b>: The existence of critical time windows for applying growth and plasticity-promoting agents and for training-dependent plasticity underscores the need for <b>careful consideration of rehabilitation onset times</b>, tailored training based on stroke type, extent, and patient history.
            <br><br>Shaping Neural Circuits</b>: In the later stages of recovery, rehabilitative training plays a crucial role in shaping the spared and newly formed CNS circuitry by selecting and stabilizing functional connections while pruning non-functional ones. Hebbian learning rules, which favor the wiring of pathways that are coincidentally active, might be fundamental in this process.
            <br><br>Enhanced Plasticity Period</b>: There is a unique period of enhanced plasticity, typically lasting 1 to 3 months after ischemic stroke, during which both spontaneous and intervention-mediated recovery from impairment are maximal.
