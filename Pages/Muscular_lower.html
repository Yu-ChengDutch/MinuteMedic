        <h1 id="welcome-title">Welcome to the lower (axio)appendicular skeleton!</h1>
        <p id="welcome-description">The lower limb includes teh foot, thigh and sometimes the hip and buttock. The main functions of the lower limb are standing, various forms of movement, as well as other activities such as dancing; and thus constitute an important part of the human body. Bipedal gait is one of the crowing achievements of human evolution!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>An introduction to anatomy</h1>
        <p>The muscles of the lower limb may be divided along two varying ways: fascial compartments, or functional groups. It is useful to understand both ways of dividing the muscular system, as it provides not only much needed repetition, but also a more thorough understanding of muscular anatomy. Furthermore, as many compartments are innervated by the same nerve and provided by the same vascular supply, they provide easy methods to remember key connections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-card">
        <h1>Structural (i.e., fascial) anatomy</h1>
        <p>From this perspective the lower limb is divided in five different parts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Muscles of the hip</li>
            <li>Muscles of the thigh</li>
            <li>Muscles of the of lower leg</li>
            <li>Muscles of the foot</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Muscles of the hip</h2>
        <p>The muscles of the hip are usually classified in functional groups such as the lateral rotator group etc. However, we can point to two structural groups:</p>
        <h3>Gluteal group</h3>
        <p>The gluteus muscles contain:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Gluteus maximus</li>
            <li>M. Gluteus medius</li>
            <li>M. Gluteus minimus</li>
            <li>M. Tensor fasciae latae</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In terms of innervation, it is easy to remember these muscles are all supplied by the <b>N. Gluteus</b>. These nerves, of which there are an inferior (M. Gluteus maximus) and a superior (other) branch, are direct branches from the sacral plexus.</p>
        <h3>Iliopsoas group</h3>
        <p>This group consists of two muscles which are essentially joined together:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Psoas maior</li>
            <li>M. Iliacus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In terms of innervation, these muscles are however different. The M. Psoas maior is innervated by direct branches from the <b>Lumbar plexus</b> while the M. Iliacus is innervated by the <b>N. Femoralis</b>. The root they both share is <b>L3</b>.</p>

        <h2>Muscles of the thigh</h2>
        <p>The thigh is divided into three parts, namely the anterior, medial and posterior compartments. They each contain various muscles, as well as nerves and vascular structures.</p>
        <h3>Anterior compartment</h3>
        <p>The anterior compartment of the thigh contains the following muscles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Sartorius</li>
            <li>M. Quadriceps (i.e., M. Rectus femoris, M. Vastus Lateralis/Intermedius/Medialis)</li>
            <li>M. Articularis genu</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>It also contains the <b>N. Femoralis</b> which it also completely innervates. This nerve enters through <b>Scarpa's triangle</b> and travels through the anterior compartment, giving off numerous branches. Important here are the three motor divisions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Nerve to M. Pectineus</li>
            <li>Anterior division - M. Sartorius</li>
            <li>Posterior division - M. Quadriceps and M. Articularis Genu</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One way to remember that the N. Femoralis is located on the front of the leg might be that this is the nerve that is stretched during the <b>femoral nerve stretch test</b> which is, in effect, a reversed Làsegue.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>N. Femoralis</b> lies in the same compartment as the M. Rectus <b>Femoris</b>!</div>

        <h3>Medial compartment</h3>
        <p>The medial compartment of the thigh contains the following muscles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Pectineus</li>
            <li>M. Obturator externus</li>
            <li>M. Gracilis</li>
            <li>M. Adductor longus/brevis/magnus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Furthermore, it contains the <b>N. Obturatorius</b>, which also innervates this compartment completely. Interestingly though, the N. Obturatorius does not innervate the M. Obturator internus!</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>N. Obturatorius</b> lies in the same compartment as the <b>M. Obturator externus</b>!</div>

        <h3>Posterior compartment</h3>
        <p>The posterior compartment of the thigh contains only the <b>Hamstrings</b>! This group of muscles consists of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Biceps femoris</li>
            <li>M. Semitendinosus</li>
            <li>M. Semimembranosus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It also contains the <b>N. Ischiadicus</b> or sciatic nerve. Important to remember is that this nerve supplies the entire hamstrings. While in English there is no easy way to remember this, in French the hamstings are called the <b> ischio-jambier</b> and hence they are innervated by the <b>N. Ischiadicus</b>. Notably, it is this muscle that is stretched during the <b>sign of Làsegue</b> and the <b>sign of Bragard</b>. When we start talking about the lower leg, it will be important to remember that the N. Ischiadicus splits into two motor branches at the <b>Fossa Poplitea</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>N. Tibialis</li>
            <li>N. Fibularis communis or N. Peroneus communis (synonyms)</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="mnemonic">The <b>N. Ischiadicus</b> innervates the <b>ischio-jambier</b>!</div>

        <h2>Muscles of the lower leg</h2>
        <h3>Anterior compartment</h3>
        <p>The anterior compartment of the leg contains four muscles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Tibialis anterior</li>
            <li>M. Extensor hallucis</li>
            <li>M. Extensor digitorum longus</li>
            <li>M. Fibularis tertius</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One way to remember the muscles in the anterior compartment, is that all muscles used to pick the foot up off the floor are located there. In music there is the famous phrase <i>four on the floor</i> for a kickdrum on every beat. Well, here we have the following mnemonic:</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">Four <b>off</b> the floor!</div>

        <p>The muscles of the posterior compartment then, are innervated by the <b>N. Fibularis profundus</b>, which is a branch of the aforementioned N. Fibularis communis which has split into two at the lateral fibula. Importantly, this muscle continues onwards towards the foot.</p>

        <h3>Posterior compartment</h3>
        <p>The posterior compartment is divided into two sub-compartments, namely the superficial and the deep posterior compartment. In general, we could say that the muscles which predominantly move the ankle are located in the superficial compartment, while the ones that are implicated in moving the toes or knee are located in the deep compartment. Note that this is not an absolute rule!</p>
        <p>Regardless of this division, the entire posterior compartment is innervated by the same nerve, namely the <b>N. Tibialis</b> which springs from the N. Ischiadicus from which it does so at the Fossa Poplitea.</p>

        <h4>Superficial compartment</h4>
        <p>The superficial compartment contains the following muscles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Triceps surae (i.e., M. Gastrocnemius and M. Soleus)</li>
            <li>M. Plantaris</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Deep compartment</h4>
        <p>The deep compartment contains the following muscles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Flexor hallucis longus</li>
            <li>M. Flexor digitorum longus</li>
            <li>M. Tibialis posterior</li>
            <li>M. Popliteus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Notably, the first three (M. Flexor hallucis longus, M. Flexor digitorum longus, M. Tibialis posterior) all pass through the <b>tarsal tunnel</b>. The M. Poplitius instead, is located at the knee.</p>

        <h3>Lateral compartment</h3>
        <p>The lateral compartment of the lower leg contains just two muscles, and both of the same group:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Fibularis longus</li>
            <li>M. Fibularis brevis</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Quite logically, these muscles are innervated by the <b>N. Fibularis superficialis</b> which branches off the N. Fibularis communis (and ultimately the N. Ischiadicus) at the knee.</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">As the <b>Fibula</b> is <b>lateral</b> tibia, so are the <b>M. Fibularis</b> located in the <b>Lateral compartment</b>!</div>

        <h2>Muscles of the foot</h2>
        <h3>Dorsal muscles of the foot</h3>
        <p>There are only two dorsal muscles of the foot, which are both extensors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Extensor hallucis brevis</li>
            <li>M. Extensor digitorum brevis</li>
        </ol>
        <p>They are both innervated by the <b>N. Fibularis profundus</b>, which is not surprising knowing that it is that same muscles that supplies the <i>extrinsic</i> extensors of the foot, namely in the anterior compartment of the lower leg.</p>
        <h3>Plantar muscles of the foot</h3>
        <p>The plantar side of the foot contains more intrisic muscles, namely all those that are responsible for more comples movements within the foot:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>M. Abductor hallucis</li>
            <li>M. Flexor digitorum brevis</li>
            <li>M. Abductor digiti minimi</li>
            <li>M. Quadratus plantae</li>
            <li>Mm. Lumbricales</li>
            <li>M. Flexor hallucis brevis</li>
            <li>M. Adductor hallucis</li>
            <li>M. Flexor digiti minimi brevis</li>
            <li>Mm. Interossei dorsales</li>
            <li>Mm. Interossei plantares</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Luckily, however, the pattern of innervation is easier to remember as all of these are innervated by either the <b>N. Plantaris medialis</b> or <b>N. Plantaris lateralis</b>, which are both branches of the N. Tibialis which traces it origin to the N. Ischiadicus.</p>

        <h1>Functional anatomy</h1>

        <h2>Movement of the hip</h2>
        <p>The hip is able to flex, extend, abduct, adduct, medial (internally) rotate and lateral (externally) rotate. The different groups of muscles implicated in these movements are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>External rotation: <b>M. Gluteus maximus</b> and the <b>lateral rotator group</b> (M. Piriformis, M. Gemellus superior, M. Gemellus inferior, M. Obturator internus, M. Obturator externus, M. Quadratus femoris)</li>
            <li>Internal rotation: <b>M. Gluteus medius</b> and <b>M. Gluteus minimus</b></li>
            <li>Extension: <b>M. Gluteus maximus</b></li>
            <li>Flexion: <b>M. Psoas maior</b> with assistance by M. Iliacus</li>
            <li>Abduction: <b>M. Gluteus medius</b></li>
            <li>Adduction: <b>Adductor group</b> (M. Adductor magnus, M. Adductor longus, M. Adductor brevis)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Movement of the knee</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Extension: <b>M. Quadriceps femoris</b>, M. Tensor fasciae latae</li>
            <li>Flexion: <b>Hamstrings</b>, M. Gracilis, M. Sartorius, M. Popliteus, M.Gastrocnemius</li>
            <li>Internal rotation: <b>M. Semimembranosus</b>, <b>M. Semitendinosus</b>, M. Gracilis, M. Sartorius, M. Popliteus</li>
            <li>External rotation: <b>M. Biceps femoris</b>, M. Tensor fasciae latae</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Important to note is that the hamstrings assist in both internal and external rotation. Furthermore, the <b>M. Popliteus</b>, the only muscle of the lower leg which acts only on the knee, serves to unlock the knee when walking by rotating the tibia laterally on the femur. The <b>M. Gastrocnemius</b> however, extends over both joints and is thus in a stretched position when the knee is extended. Hence why passive dorsiflexion of the ankle with a <i>flexed</i> knee may show contractures of the M. Soleus, while the same movement with an extended knee may show contractures of the M. Gastrocnemius. This test is called the <b>Silfverskiöld</b>. </p>

        <h2>Movement of the ankle</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Dorsiflexion: <b>M. Tibialis anterior</b>, M. Extensor digitorum longus, M. Extensor hallucis longus</li>
            <li>Plantar flexion: <b>Triceps surae</b> (M. Gastrocnemius, M. Soleus), M. Fibularis longus, M. Fibularis brevis, M. Flexor digitorum longus, M. Tibialis posterior</li>
            <li>Eversion: <b>M. Fibularis longus</b>, <b>M. Fibularis brevis</b>, M. Extensor digitorum longus, M. Fibularis tertius</li>
            <li>Inversion: <b>M. Tibialis posterior</b>, Triceps surae, M. Flexor hallucis, M. Flexor digitorum longus, M. Tibialis anterior</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A good way to remember the muscles responsible for e- and inversion are that eversion is towards the fibula (and thus done by the M. Fibularis) while inversion is towards the tibia (hence done by the M. Tibialis).</p>

        <div class="mnemonic">Inversion is towards the <b>tibia</b> and done by the <b>M. Tibialis posterior</b></div>

        <div class="mnemonic">Eversion is towards the <b>fibula</b> and done by the <b>M. Fibularis longus</b></div>

        <h1>Motor testing</h1>
        <p>While it is of course common and useful to test individual muscles, the lower body is a complex entity that deserves to be tested in its entirety. Hence, we will describe individual testing, as well as integrated testing.</p>

        <h2>Neuromotor testing</h2>
        <p>Following the ASIA-system for assessing spinal cord injury, we describe the following myotomes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>L2: Hip flexion</li>
            <li>L3: Knee extension</li>
            <li>L4: Ankle dorsiflexion</li>
            <li>L5: Big toe extension</li>
            <li>S1: Ankle plantar flexion</li>
            <li>S2: Knee flexion</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Similarly, in terms of reflexes relevant for the lower limbs we may describe the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>L1: Cremasteric reflex (superficial reflex)</li>
            <li>L3: Patellar reflex (stretch reflex)</li>
            <li>S1: Achilles reflex</li>
